My body is the mansion and you don't
need the keys because this time the
doors are wide open and the screendoor
slamming makes me want to remove it all
together.
The garden is overgrown and the paths
worn in the grass have begun to sprout
brave and hearty weeds unaware of boots
that in the past stood crushing watching
through windows.
but your still not peering over the fence
not sneaking in my backdoor not now what
do I do lock or unlock you or just leave
the house and wait on the path and wait.
