two motercycles on the highway about the same size going the
same direction at the same speed would never crash into each
other nor cross paths at all out of mutual respect.  if you were
to pull either one of them aside they would surely say
well i dont want him crashin in to me but i spose it would
be fun if we was doin' Chips turns and maybe we could stop for
lunch or somethin why? does he want to do that? Things just
weren't planned that way some things you just got to plan
or hope for five unlucky events in a row makin' you friends.
