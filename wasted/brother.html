I know my dear brotherlove of
order and discipline
the hours you have spent on her
I know she ruffles your hair and
makes you healthy breakfasts for
a surprise and reads the complicated
sections of the newspaper and you
talk and talk and fight and sleep
She is strong and smart and
beautiful and know if I could find
her I would go anywhere to and I
would bring her to the edge of your bed
I would bring her right to you.
