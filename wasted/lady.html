The lady who comes in for postage has such perfect little shoes.
No wedding ring cats go home listen to Bread albums and Captain
and Tennille and clean the little shoes always try to stay on carpet
be very vareful when in the street
And always she is gracious and she smiles at me and quiet.
She writes lots of letters and everyday talks to her wild sister
on the phone getting older stole her only boyfriend but now he's a
drunk and her sister cries and she listens and is genuinely sorry.<p>
