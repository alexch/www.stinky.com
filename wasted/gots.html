Gots hearts in my streets hearts
in my book classically lined valentines
on the road in my head going to mountain
places to sleep tall trees climbin' em
drawin' hearts up there waay up so nobody
will see em at least not from the streets
and not from their rooms and not from their
kitchens and places of work.
