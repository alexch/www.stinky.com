If I thought for a minute that I could take you home I would run right out and buy new yellow sheets. If you could I bet you would buy em for me.
<p>
If I thought for one minute that I could go home with you I would paint a really big blue dog on your front porch.
<p>
If I wasn't me but a really ferocious beast I would just take you and they would have to lock me up forever until I died and went to hell where I would finally learn my lesson and return as me who would never dream of doing that again. It's good that I wouldn't.
<p>
If I was purity I wouldn't have to think of you at all.
<p>
If I was a long dirt road and I felt on me your bare feet<br>
I would lead you astray.
