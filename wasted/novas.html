The most beautiful thing about Nova's is that
lots of times there are old ladies driving
them having no idea about cool and well they
should not.  Bless them for it, I say, but give
me your cool car anyway or I'll steal it.

I'll jack up the back end with really big tires
and Mags and Perellis.  I'll paint it black
put flames on the hood and on my door it will
say "Leslie" in small cursive letters. My license
plate will say "ICY" because i'm cold as ice, man.
Cold water flames.
