You don<b>'</b>t love me
and I burnt my tapioca so the magic
puffs are big weird lumps and i<b>'</b>m
eating it anyway cuz I don<b>'</b>t have any tomato
soup
and all the boys who love me hate me now
cuz i<b>'</b>m evil or they are off in Europe
spending all their money forever
and my boss hates me<b>,</b> too<b>.</b>
My cat died last summer and I forgot
again to buy a new bird water thing and
the birds can barely drink water out of the
margarine thing and they are probably really
thirsty
and my roomate is always asleep and he would
probably be nice to me if I woke him up but
that would be pathetic and my roomate the
other one is really depressed too and hes
learning how to play the violin right now
and its squeaking at me
and my hair is really dumb
I<b>'</b>m really sad<b>.</b>
