 When I'm older sometimes I want to be
 One of those fuzzy clothes Moms
 With graying hair and clear blue eyes.
 
 I'll be tan from too much skiing
 And rich as I could want to be
 Volvo driving carseat carrying kids
 And ex pensive wood toys littered about
 My Victorian Parquet floored mansion
 With really nice rugs i bought overseas.
 
 Tan hands and a plain gold band.
 
 There will be at least four cars
 Parked in my backyard and tools
 and a crazy garden and a nice lawn
 
 And my husband comes home and
 He's tired and we sit together quietly
 Because there  are no kids but a dog
 And I still buy junk so there is junk
 Everywhere and maybe we are rich cuz
 We write but all the money goes to
 Travelling. We've been everywhere.
