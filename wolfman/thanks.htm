Tribute<BR>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Thanks for your tribute to Wolfman Jack.&nbsp; I 
visited the legend's</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>grave in Belvidere this week and it was truly an 
emotional</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>experience for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a jock in a 
couple of majors including</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>LA during Bob's career, he effected me as he did 
so many</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>others.&nbsp;&nbsp; His daughter Joy was 
tragically killed in an auto</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>wreck a couple of months ago and is buried 
beside the man</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>in the side lawn of a run-down, weed infested 
old home where</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>his wife of 28-year Lu resides in what appears 
to me to be</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>abject poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working with 
a family friend, Bruce</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Mayo, on a film project that will do Wolf 
justice!&nbsp; As Lu owns</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>the rights to &quot;Have Mercy&quot;, this is 
the working title, however the</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>story will be greatly expanded as Lu has some 
really incredible</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>stories that never were printed and Bob has a 
huge library of</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>home films that have never seen the light of 
day.&nbsp; If you can</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>imagine this.&nbsp; Bruce took me to a 
ramshackled building that</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>once was Bob's working studio.&nbsp; 
Inside,...filing cabinets of</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>hand-written liners that he used on his 
shows.&nbsp; What an</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>experience!&nbsp; Wolfman Jack is gone but not 
forgotten and</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>be on the lookout for a feature film that will 
tear the entertainment</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>industry a new one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your 
tribute Stinky, have</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>mercy and stay tuned!</FONT></DIV>
