Subject: A Little Black

In the elevator this morning, flush from a workout, I was witness to two
odd conversations. The first was between three young women; one was
giddily relating her recent social adventures to the other perky two.
Apparently she had recently undergone some sort of sexual awakening.
"Irene created a monster," she said, referring to her friend whose
advice had presumably been to live a little. She described dating
various "boys." 


"And so we went out again, you know, dinner, dancing, out 'til 4, that
whole thing, and then that night..." (a dramatic pause) "...I kissed a
different boy!" Her friends indulged her with appreciative gasps as they
left the elevator.


The doors closing, the conversation of the other couple rose to my ears.
A black man and woman.


"...I mean ain't nobody pure..." 


"Uh-huh" 


"...not black people, not white people..." At this point she nudged my
backpack; I turned from the door to face them.


"Yeah, you know it," the man said to me. "You know what I mean. You got
a little black in you."


I smiled agreeably, not quite knowing how to react. ("Agent XZ47 to
mother ship: my disguise is a success! The foolish subjects think that I
am one of them.")


The door opened, and as they walked out I replied, "Everyone's got a
little black in them." His "Yeah, that's true" was truncated by the door
shushing closed.
