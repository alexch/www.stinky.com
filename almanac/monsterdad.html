Sunday morning I'm sitting on my couch, tapping on my laptop. Jaime's asleep in my bed, New York 1 is on TV. I'm not paying much attention. "Mumble mumble double murder... mumble Flatiron District..." I look up, since Jaime's office building is in the Flatiron District. They're showing a crime scene. The caption says "36 West 25th Street."

<p>
It's Jaime's building.

Some asshole kidnapped his own children, brought them to the basement, murdered them with an axe, and hid their bodies there. He's the building manager. Jaime dealt with him on a regular basis about maintenance issues. She says they used to kid around with him about how he looks just like Christopher Walken. You know, the actor who always plays a near-psycho who's just about to crack.

I thought about waking Jaime up with "I've got bad news -- they found the bodies of those kids I killed and stashed in your basement" but decided instead to just tell her straight. She still thought I was pulling her leg until she saw the news for herself.

The New York Post cover today reads "MONSTER DAD" (see attached gif)
