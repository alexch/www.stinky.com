Our new office microwave is a little scary. When it finishes cooking,
a little message scrolls across its 7-character LED display:


    E N J O Y   Y O U R   M E A L


When I remarked on this it set off a barrage of HAL jokes.


"No HAL-9000 Microwave has ever overcooked a burrito, Dave. It must be
due to human error."


"Open the oven bay door, HAL!"
"I'm sorry, Dave. This meal is too important to be jeapordized."
