Just heard a blurb on NPR about the controversy over renaming National 
Airport to Ronald Reagan Airport. Reportedly, nobody feels too strongly 
about it either way, except for the air traffic controllers' union members, 
who haven't forgotten that RR fired all the controllers and brought in scabs 
in 1981. One crusty fellow put it this way (these are his exact words):

"And for us to have to utter his name every time we announce the airport, 
would be to pull out our heart and rub a block of salt around in there."

Hey, why don't they call it the Ricky Ricardo Airport Nacional--then someone
would say "And for us to have to utter his name every time we announce the
airport, would be to pull out our heart and rub a margarita with salt around
in there."

(plus returning planes could be "Lucies" or something and they would have an
excuse to play Latin musak all the time)
