Overheard in the elevator: a conversation between three people on their
way up to the black-format radio station on the top floor:


"I mean, I use the scratch for, you know, for effect."

"Like Grandmaster Flash."

"Yeah, but he says, you know, as per..."

"As per, as per, as per..."

"Yeah, huh."

"Tell him to send you a memo."

"Uh-huh."

"Get it in writing. That seems to be the way things are done around
here."

"Huh. To: Program Director. Subject: Vooga Vooga."

"As per the discussion, please use only two to three vooga vooga per
mix, as opposed to 25 or 30 vooga vooga."

"We already got one Grandmaster Flash."

"Uh-huh."


("Vooga vooga" I took to refer to the sound a DJ makes by "scratching" 
a record on a turntable.)
