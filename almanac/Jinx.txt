Not half an hour after I sent that message bragging that I'd found a
place to live, I got a call from the other Samantha who lives there,
who says that the actual lease-holder, Johanna, had gone and found a
subletter for Samantha Lawrence's room, i.e. the room I was going to
get, without ever telling Samantha, who sublet it to me, so now
there's this whole other guy who's going to be moving in tomorrow, who
isn't me. I guess I shouldn't have sent that message without key in
hand. I'll keep you posted.


By the way... Know of any rooms for rent?
