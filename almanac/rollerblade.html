<h2>Rollerblade in the City: A Testimonial </h2>

<p><em>&quot;...in form and moving, how express and admirable; in
action how like an angel; in apprehension how like a god...&quot;
- Hamlet </em></p>

<p>A 90's Stormtrooper's body armor, beyond aerodynamic, all
molded plastic, sculpted panels, joints, vents, buckles. Muted
and glistening grays. A laser would richocet to char nearby
walls. </p>

<p>Like walking, only faster, and with the thrill of nearby
death. </p>

<p>Holding your breath as you power past a garbage truck.
Inhaling the unexpected exhaust of a city bus, tasting the soot
settle in your lungs, but smelling the clear breath of the summer
stratosphere far above. </p>

<p>Panting at a stop light, squinting through the scraped
remainder of a newsbox sticker at the day's headline:
&quot;SENATE POSSES BULL TO ROAST, TO $515, MEDIUM WAGE&quot;. </p>

<p>Imagine a rollerblade ad: a cross between Nike and &quot;Be
All That You Can Be.&quot; Young, athletic, serious. Soundtrack:
a punk band, or maybe techno, that's willing to sell out. Gearing
up: snaps and latches and quick edits. Lock and load. On the
street: dodging pedestrians, grabbing taxi bumpers for a block or
two. Closeup on the forehead: intense eyes, a bead of sweat, the
helmet (pushed back further than it would really be, to minimize
the encumbrance), maybe a dangling strap. Kids doing tricks,
somersaults, flips. A young mother with her happy waddling
elbow-pad-laden child. Cut to a solo athlete, in silhouette,
alone at dawn. &quot;Rollerblade.&quot; No tag line. </p>

<p>Fade to black. </p>
