Subject: My Dream 
Date: Tue, 30 May 1995 12:21:52 -0400 (EDT) 

This morning, while commuting along the New Jersey Turnpike, I dreamed of
Henry Kissinger, three feet tall, naked and hairy except for black bikini
briefs, squinting and blind since he was missing his glasses, strapped to a
knife-thrower's wheel of fortune. I believe this relates to the foreign
policy implications of the episode where Shirley tied Laverne to just such a
wheel for a talent show, ignored her screams, and threw knives at her
blindfolded. 

Just thought you should know.
