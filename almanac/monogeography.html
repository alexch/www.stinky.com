<h2>Monogeography</h2>

<p>19-21 Feb, 1996</p>

<h3>Alex:</h3>

<p>My uncle always says, &quot;When are you going to invent
'beaming up' technology?&quot; My reply is it's not necessary.
Why bother moving people from place to place when we can just
replicate the same place all over the country -- the planet? When
you're in Starbuck's, there you are, whether Astor Place or
Hawthorne St or Kuala Lampur. Likewise the Gap, McDonald's,
Banana Republic. Or any cobblestoned downtown walking mall. Or
any air-conditioned nightmare of a megamall, or any superstore,
be it Fred Meyer or Bradlees or Price Club. Or any movie theatre.
Or any shabby cramped bulletin boarded bookstore -- is this City
Lights San Francsico or Shakespeare &amp; Co Paris or Shakespeare
&amp; Co 716 Broadway or Shakespeare &amp; Co 2259 Broadway? Or
any interstate, any onramp. Or any falafel joint from Tel Aviv to
St. Mark's Place. The monoculture megalith keeps juggernauting
along. </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>&quot;The main strand [of our modern western history] is the
progressive erection, by western hands, of a scaffolding within
which all the once separate societies have built themselves into
one.&nbsp; From the beginning humankind has been partitioned; in
our day we have at last become united.&nbsp; The western
handiwork that has made this union possible has not been carried
out with open eyes, like David's unselfish labours for the
benefit of Solomon; it has been performed in heedless ignorance
of its purpose, like the labours of the animalculae that build a
coral reef up from the bottom of the sea till at length an atoll
rises above the waves.&nbsp; But our western build scaffolding is
built of less durable material than that.&nbsp; The most obvious
ingredient in it is technology and man cannot live by technology
alone.&nbsp; In the fullness of time, when the oecumenical house
of many mansions stands firmly on its own foundations and the
temporary western technological scaffolding falls away - as I
have no doubt that it will - I believe it will become manifest
that the foundations are firm at last because they have been
carried down to the bedrock of religion.&quot; </p>

<h3>Alex:</h3>

<p>Wow. There's no use saying anything anymore; someone else has
already said it better. </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>true. </p>

<h3>Alex:</h3>

<p>What's the pub. date of this nice book? </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>I actually found this in a greatest hits compilation called
&quot;Philosophy for a time of crisis&quot; ed. Adrienne Koch,
1959. Included is a very interesting discussion of the communist
morass from Marx to Lenin to Stalin. Interesting because of the
new historical perspective. </p>

<h3>Alex:</h3>

<p>And what's he mean by the bedrock of religion? </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>All of our undertakings and existence will be based on the
principle of going beyond our scope as individuals. We will take
on a fuller consciousness of ourselves as part of a larger system
and therefore we will move beyond ourselves. We will find
motivation from the principle of doing what needs to be done not
only for our individual self but for the whole system (the earth,
its community) of which we all are a part. </p>

<h3>Alex:</h3>

<p>Is it that the new society's mores and codes will take on the
firmness once possessed by religions? </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>yes </p>

<h3>Alex:</h3>

<p>Or that the new society will discover old religions? </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>this has already happened. </p>

<h3>Robyn:</h3>

<p>ps: Albert Einstein says: &quot;Science without religion is
lame, religion without science is blind.&quot;</p>
