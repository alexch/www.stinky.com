The Saddest Thing I Ever Heard:


"Former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali lit the Olymic torch at the
opening ceremony to thunderous applause. Mr. Ali suffers from
Parkinson's disease."


Nick and I saw footage of his 1964 title fight with Sonny Liston last
night. The man was incredible -- dodging, weaving, jabbing like
lightning.


After he won the fight he went typically bananas, shouting out, "I am
the greatest! I talk to God every day! I am God! I shook the world! I
just turned 22, which means I *am* the greatest in the world! I am the
Devil! I am the cow!" and so forth. He was the very picture of youth,
strength, power and pride.


Parkinson's is a degenerative neuromotor disorder. Those afflicted
suffer progressive paralysis. In the middle stages of the disease, they
can only move in broad, deliberate, jerky motions. 


He's only 54. 


Float like a butterfly, sting like -
