Subject: Purify the Body

This morning I'm at the gym. I've just finished my morning swim and
I'm outside on the steps, putting on my rollerblades. A guy rides by
on a bicycle, going fairly slowly, just ambling along. He's a young
black man, shaved head, athletic clothing. As he passes he looks me
right in the eye and in a lovely preacher's baritone he says,

"Purify the body."

To which I reply, "Okay!"

(And then a second later, remembering my workout, add "I just did!" He
turned back and smiled at me over his shoulder before riding off.)

Just thought I should spread the word.
