I quit.

No, really, I did: I quit my job last week.

"Quit" may be too strong a word. I'm still on quite good terms with
Earthweb. I honestly think EarthWeb is an excellent company with a lot
of great people and a lot of profit potential. But in 2-1/2 years, a
lot of things happened... it wasn't the same old company... and after
much soul-searching and gnashing of teeth, I decided it was time to
move on.

Just to forestall any rumors, I thought I'd state some disclaimers
about my current plans.

* I will not be either joining or founding a comet cult.

* I will not be joining the staff of C-net, I-chat, or Kentucky Fried
Chicken.

* I will not be shaving my head and joining a Zen Buddhist temple
(although I reserve the right to go on any number of spiritual
quests).

* I will not be writing a novel about three young intellectual
slackers named Jock, Manny and Quasar who form a startup and, after a
series of entertaining but educational business mishaps, start
developing software in a hot new object-oriented language called
"Spunk."

* I will not be accepting the position of C.E.O. at Apple.

What I -will- be doing is much less interesting than any of that: I'll
be consulting part-time, doing Java training and trying to figure out
what I want to do next.
