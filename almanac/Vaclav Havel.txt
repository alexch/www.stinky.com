Name Dropping Part 2

Flush from my brush with hi-tech corporate destiny, I went to the
Knitting Factory to hang out downstairs with Steve. We went upstairs
to listen to Ism in the AlterKnit room... when who should we pass on
the stairs, coming out of the James Blood Ulmer performance, than
Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and all around Cool
Guy. He was in town for the UN 50th and came down to hear some good
music. He paused next to the Mac they have set up in the bar that's
connected to the Internet... In a flash, I saw my chance... I
approached his small entourage with the intention of accosting the
great man with a pick-up line for the twenty-first century... "Have
you ever surfed the Web, Mr. President?" ... But a thousand
milliseconds before I arrived, he lost interest in the screen and
moved on, leaving me to flounder in a wake of suits and slavic
accents. 

(Actually, he only had like 4 people with him, but it's more dramatic
that way... and I think he'd appreciate the drama.)

Milos Forman was also there that evening.


P.S. Did I mention that I saw Apollo 13 sitting right next to the head
nurse from E.R.? I went out to get popcorn and we had knee sex.
