<p><font size="5">Hotel</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">I arrive at my hotel room in
mid-morning, returning from setting up the modem in the computer
in Allison's suite 7 floors down. The door is open: the maid is
here. As I walk in she's in the bathroom; I announce myself with
a &quot;hi&quot; and move to the window. I can't take the shower
I'd planned, and I'm putting off going over my speech notes until
the last possible moment, so I pick up my novel and plant myself
at the window. The sun is phenomenal; by the time I woke up this
morning at 7 a.m. a shaft of California brilliance had snuck in
through the triple shades (a light, translucent gauze, merely the
suggestion of a blind; a pleated, olive green drape on a metal
track, pinioned by a dangling white handbar; finally, a thick
rayon, patterned in muted polygons, normally tied back, the last
line of optical defense) and was burning a hole in my bedcover.
Now I'm safe in a corner at the mahogany-stained table, pages
sheltered from the shine, but I'm still allowed a 14-story
vantage on San Jose: red-tiled roofs, off-white walls, palm
trees, public transit, 20-story hotels looking as natural as
cactii, diminishing in their casual progress towards the low
deserted mountains out of town. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">I'm reading The Mezzanine, by
Nicholson Baker. It's an inspection of the minutae of modern
life. From the back cover: &quot;It lends to milk cartons the
associative richness of Marcel Proust's madelines.&quot; The
narrator examines in detail the machinery and psychology of
straws, escalators, tone arms, office supplies, register lines at
the pharmacy, sandwiches, urinals - it sounds painful but it's
honestly delightful. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">My eyes notice the activity in
the center of the room and wander towards it. It's the maid,
stuffing pillows into pillowcases. As this very subject was
addressed by Baker at some length, I take notice. Her technique
involves holding the pillow in her right hand, bunching it up
into a shallow U, while her left hand shakes the case open. She
then guides the far corner of the pillow into the opening made by
her palm, now splayed inside the case. Once both near ends of the
pillow are inside, she then shakes and pushes until the pillow is
snug against the far side. Now she's left with a dangling
rectangle of unused pillowcase extending past the side of the
pillow. What's to be done? Her solution is as elegant as it is
unexpected: she folds one side of the pillowcase under the other,
snug against the pillow; the remaining scrap of fabric is then
folded inward onto itself, its straightness assured by grabbing
from the inside and snapping tight to the lateral sides, using
the tension between the corners, enhanced by the pillow's very
presence, to straighten and tighten the line. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">Intrigued, I continued watching
as she attacked the other bed. With a casual lift, she spread out
the bottom sheet - not fitted, but flat -- a sister or mistress
to the dominant topsheet, whose highly visible, businesslike
cuffs are matched by her quarter-inch, slightly frilled,
pink-threaded hem - and smoothed it down on the near side of the
bed. The foot-side edge of the sheet lies flat against the edge
of the mattress, falling over only on the sides. She tucked in
the corner near the headboard; the details of this motion were
hidden to me. To my surprise, instead of tucking in both sides
immediately, she then spread out the topsheet and, after only a
cursory straightening, the blanket (a muted orange man-made
fiber; if you pinch it you get a fingerfull of peach-colored
fuzz). The masculine cuff is now turned over, providing a
supervisory interface between the unruly scratchiness of the
blanket and the chin of the reclining client. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">By this time I wasn't even
feigning interest in the novel; for some time now it had been
resting at my lap. She approached the bottom corner, and with
three swift strokes, executed a perfect corner tuck. I had the
opportunity to witness her technique once more, and I record it
here with awe. One: the mattress is lifted slightly with the left
hand, and the bottom edge of blanket-and-sheet is swept cleanly
under with the blade edge of her right. Two: (and this is the
miraculous part): a triangle of excess fabric is held slightly
above the mattress by its vertex as her right hand adjusts the
dangling cover resting akimbo along the long side of the bed. The
triangle manages to remove just enough cover to allow what in my
feeble corners is a chaotic clump to settle into a more natural,
straighter line. (Note that the portion of the cover tucked under
in step one affords the clearance necessary for the right hand to
finish its task unaided.) Finally, three: the triangle joins its
fellow strands under the mattress, and the line is smoothed and
straightened all the way back to the headboard. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">Ultimately, she grabbed the
pillows from the other bed, where they had been waiting in
readiness, and dropped them lightly at their natural position
above the turned-down cuff. I just checked: all four pillows are
placed tuck-side down, so the hotel client is faced with an
archetypical pillow, unblemished by any undue (however ingenious)
folds. Later, as the afternoon fades and the guest is more likely
to return for an afternoon nap or shoes-off phone call or
television show, she will return, to lay the heavy, quilted
bedspread, hiding her meticulous bedmaking work from the sight of
the very guests who will not think to consider the attention and
care it took to create their feeling of snug, smooth comfort. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">&quot;You want a vaccuum,
sir?&quot; Her accent is Spanish. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="palatino">&quot;No, that's all
right.&quot; The conversation I had been considering broaching
perished stillborn. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She pushed her cart,
its plastic bottles and mysterious implements clanking
soundlessly, through the door of my room without further eye
contact, pausing only to remove the doorstop - without needing to
stoop -- by pulling it up by its chain, which chain, on entering
the room ten minutes before, she had presciently affixed to the
doorknob. </font></p>
