Over the weekend I was sick with a cold. I dreamed I was driving back
from Marin into San Francisco in a big white Buick convertible. The
lady at the toll booth (on the Marin side) asked for $72 toll. I was
outraged! Plus I only had a dollar in my wallet. She said they changed
the rates to capitalize on the non-business-hours traffic, and showed
me a sign:


9:00-10:00  $2
10:00-12:00 $3
12:00-1:00  $2
1:00-3:00   $2
3:00-5:00   $3
5:00-6:00   $6
6:00-7:00   $46
8:00-9:00   $64
9:00-10:00  $72
10:00-12:00 $57


I thought, well, I'll just turn around and see if I can spend the
night with Kevin. But the road was one-way -- no turnaround! I made
friends with her and she let me pass, but in order to pass I had to
park my car right after the toll booth and walk a hundred feet or
so. At the end of the lane I looked around for my car but I couldn't
find it. I was totally disoriented and couldn't even remember which
way I had come from. So I had to wander around. It was like a summer
camp. There were camp counselors leading around groups of children,
and talking to them intelligently -- not talking down to them, using
big words, but communicating clearly, and the kids understood. The
counselors were dressed in animal masks, like birds and foxes. I
believe there was a compound on the other side of the hill that I had
to get in past the security in order to get my car back, but I can't
really remember, and I woke up soon after.
