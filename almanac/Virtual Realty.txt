This is to announce that David Gochfeld, Lisa Gluskin and Alex Chaffee
have finally forked over an absurd amount of money for the right to
live in a ridiculously small space in an obscenely hip neighborhood
for a term of one year or whenever the landlord realizes we have cats
and kicks us out. We will henceforth be slightly more available during
business hours and apologize for any inconvenience our week in broker
hell may have caused any of you. You're all invited to the
housewarming party; we'll set the date once we get some furniture.


Alex Dave and Lisa
