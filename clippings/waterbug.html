No one knows the name of these <i>men</i>,<p>
but they lie sleeping in the water.<p>
These <i>swimmers</i> are often seen<p>
lying in the mud looking for fringed hind legs<p>
or casting their electric eggs<p>
on the surface of great shadows in the air.<p>
They stride about the surface of their lives<p>
or swim through at the bottom to avoid<p>
its most painful, familiar stings.<p>
Many of them eat algae and scum<p>
to spend the time.<p>
<p>
<br><p>
<p>
These water boatmen, back swimmers<p>
have a mate to plant their oars within<p>
which can cause them to serve eggs<p>
for short periods.<p>
<p>
<br><p>
<p>
Then the wise <i>bugs</i> move through their home s<p>
and fly to a new pool in which to live<p>
because of their peculiar habit of leaving<p>
their complete, spiderlike life histories on film.<p>
<p>
