<B>ST. CRISPIN, THE PATRON SAINT OF SHOEMAKERS</B>

<p><br>

<img src="the.gif" align=left alt="The"> &nbsp; learned &nbsp; teachers of &nbsp; living<br>
were &nbsp; tortured dreadfully &nbsp; with &nbsp; an awl &nbsp; in Gaul<br>
and &nbsp; visited &nbsp; afterward &nbsp; by &nbsp; very poor &nbsp; shoemakers.<br>
Whenever &nbsp; these shoemakers &nbsp;,&nbsp; Crispin and &nbsp; Crispin ,<br>
came to &nbsp; the &nbsp; small town &nbsp; of Gaul, &nbsp; they did<br>
this &nbsp; and &nbsp; that &nbsp; without &nbsp; reason &nbsp; for &nbsp; love.<br>
Their fame &nbsp; spread &nbsp; from them &nbsp; to &nbsp; the &nbsp; heathen &nbsp; emperor,<br>
a &nbsp; patron saint &nbsp; of &nbsp; pictures &nbsp; of &nbsp; money &nbsp; and &nbsp; victory .<br>
They were &nbsp; arrested , &nbsp; tried &nbsp; in &nbsp; Christ's &nbsp; shoes &nbsp; and beheaded.<br>
In the &nbsp; palm of &nbsp; any &nbsp; shoemakers &nbsp; right &nbsp; hand,<br>
you see the &nbsp; story of &nbsp; two brothers &nbsp; you may know ,<br>
<br>
one &nbsp; is &nbsp; a saint &nbsp; , &nbsp; the other &nbsp; is &nbsp; a &nbsp; saint .<br>
<br>
At last , &nbsp; the &nbsp; making of shoes &nbsp; is &nbsp; thought &nbsp; of ,<br>
and &nbsp; the people &nbsp; in their &nbsp; century .<br>
<br>
<br><br>
So &nbsp; w h a t .<br>
