To-day, the hunter in curious corduroys,<br>
saw he in the leather boots and <br>
fur cap through the unbroken forest,<br>
leaning on his gun and covered with<br>
small buildings from the little colony.<br>
<br>
In the summer, his dream had fallen asleep<br>
where he stood and waited for himself.<br>
Sidewalks and flower-beds covered the man<br>
at his base - green lawns, houses<br>
with proches rose steeply over the spot and<br>
out of sight.<br>
<br>
The inhabitants stood on a runway<br>
and graciously waved.<br>
<br>
As the other hunter gazed intently<br>
upon all of them,<br>
he saw that they were hemmed in<br>
from the tracks of a fox that waited<br>
in the cold afternoon.<br>
<br>
A dream built inside out would come true.<br>
None but the hunter built it<br>
d e e p in the woods,<br>
where time has swept away the outside<br>
as the fox run think on a midwinter mountainside .<br>
<br>
