<font size=+2>A</font> nobly born &nbsp; young man was walking &nbsp; the streets<br>
one &nbsp; Christmas Eve &nbsp; when &nbsp; he heard &nbsp; from heaven,<br>
``Give &nbsp; my children &nbsp; a &nbsp; splendid &nbsp; thrust &nbsp; of love<br>
in  &nbsp; their stockings &nbsp; and &nbsp; pray &nbsp; for &nbsp; all children &nbsp; to starve.''<br>
<br>
Nicholas &nbsp; lifted an open window and &nbsp; was now<br>
on the verge &nbsp; of &nbsp; three daughters.<br>
The &nbsp; second  &nbsp; he heard  &nbsp; a girl's  &nbsp; voice say:<br>
``Not &nbsp; to-night, Father, &nbsp; thanks &nbsp; '',<br>
he left the &nbsp; house of  &nbsp; the &nbsp; proud &nbsp; father<br>
on tiptoe,  &nbsp; and &nbsp; discovered &nbsp; a &nbsp; street &nbsp; of &nbsp; bars.<br>
<br><br><br>

St. Nicholas <i>took</i> &nbsp; his &nbsp; fill in &nbsp; these bars<br>
for the sake &nbsp;  &nbsp; of God , the Lover of  &nbsp; children<br>
and of mankind.<br>
Let us &nbsp; go &nbsp; to &nbsp;  the bar and a  &nbsp; second  &nbsp; and  &nbsp;  &nbsp; third bar.<br>
This is the  &nbsp; secret gift &nbsp; Nicholas inherited ,<br>
Master of the  &nbsp; lost &nbsp; gift &nbsp; from God .<br>
