WILLOW
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<p>

Willows are so pliable,<p>
split open and &nbsp;&nbsp; furry &nbsp;&nbsp; against &nbsp; the ground.<p>
The &nbsp; silky hairs underneath<p>
let out tiny, &nbsp; downy seeds.<p>
Other willows in &nbsp;&nbsp; the honey &nbsp; regions of soil<p>
are blown &nbsp;&nbsp; by &nbsp;&nbsp; young &nbsp; fully developed <i>catkins</i><p>
and grow &nbsp; tiny willows which &nbsp; all bend easily.<p>
A typical willow uses good protection &nbsp; on the &nbsp; branches<p>
and the &nbsp; tall-growing &nbsp; willows are &nbsp; very useful<p>
in making &nbsp; 140 feet stamens &nbsp; appear on &nbsp; wicker furniture.<p>
Their roots &nbsp; are the &nbsp; height of &nbsp; Eskimos in the Arctic.<p>
The branches, and wood and &nbsp; wind &nbsp; and twigs &nbsp; and pistils and &nbsp; roots<p>
usually &nbsp; form a &nbsp; tree.<p>
<br>
Willow is the name on the seeds<p>
planted &nbsp; on a riverbank feeding &nbsp; the &nbsp; flow<p>
of Willows in &nbsp; the world.<p>
These ``trees'' are almost all &nbsp; the &nbsp; inch tall &nbsp; ever see.<p>
