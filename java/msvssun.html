Subject: MS vs Sun: Actual API Diffs Now Available
Date: Thu, 9 Oct 1997 13:05:00 -0400

&gt;From the press release:

    IE 4.0 adds public API into several &quot;java.&quot; packages. Several methods
and fields were added to the awt, lang, and net packages. In addition, a
small number of &quot;java.&quot; public methods were removed.

I decided not to take either Sun's or Microsoft's word for it and wrote a
script that compares the class files directly. I used javap from JDK1.1.3,
and looked at all the public classes defined in java.* from JDK1.1.3's
classes.zip file. I'm using MS's Java from the newly released IE4.0,
c:\windows\java\packages\Dbzxv3bl.zip

The results? You can see for yourself at
<a href="msdiff.txt">http://www.stinky.com/java/msdiff.txt</a>

The script compares only public classes. It ignores redeclarations of
methods as &quot;native public&quot; (since it's perfectly valid for MS to use native
code to implement their version of the APIs). It also wouldn't notice if MS
added any public classes to their java.* hierarchy (I can check that too if
you like, but that wasn't a specific complaint of the lawsuit.) It also
didn't notice if a &quot;new&quot; method was actually an override, although I went
through and cleaned out some of those. I also cleaned out cases where a
method varied only by the addition or removal of a &quot;synchronized&quot; keyword.

Note also that this deals only with interfaces (declarations) -- if MS
changed the implementation of any methods, for instance, as Sun alleges,
changing the actual color returned from one of the color classes, this will
not pick that out. It also does not address the other major issue of the
lawsuit: <strong>that MS refuses to develop RMI and JNI in favor of their own
proprietary solutions.
</strong>
The highlights:

* Yes, MS added some public methods and fields.

* As far as I can tell, MS did *not* remove any public methods.</pre>

<pre><strong>*** This is wrong! Microsoft removed </strong></pre>

<pre><strong>java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream:
&lt;     public java.lang.String toString(java.lang.String);
</strong>
* For the most part, the changes seem to be shortcuts for Windows-specific
functions, like adding a getNativeServices() call to java.lang.Runtime, or
adding getNativeData() to java.awt.Font. No Java application developer would
use these methods; they're probably for use by other MS-implementation
classes, and they had to be declared public because those classes are in
different packages.

* There are a few actual functional additions that might confuse a
developer, including:

java.awt.Window:
&gt;     public java.awt.Point location();

java.util.ResourceBundle:
&gt;     public final java.awt.Menu getMenu(java.lang.String);
&gt;     public final java.awt.MenuBar getMenuBar(java.lang.String);

* The &quot;50 fields&quot; were all added to a *single* class, java.util.Locale. MS
added 50 different locations as constants that were left out of the JDK
class, e.g.

&gt;     public static final java.util.Locale CROATIAN;
&gt;     public static final java.util.Locale CZECH;
&gt;     public static final java.util.Locale DANISH;

* I found *no* differences in java.net (as claimed by Sun).

Disclaimer: I am a staunch Java supporter and a true believer in 100% Pure
Java. Personally, I think Sun was right to file a lawsuit, even if only as a
P.R. maneuver. It may help the public understand just how important purity
is to the Java platform. Without true write-once, run-anywhere, Java becomes
just another OS-dependent application development language. Whether these
particular changes were actually a threat to WORA...

Subject: MS Diff Update (including Netscape diffs)<br>
Date: Sat, 11 Oct 1997 07:07:31 -0400<br>
<br>
A few new developments:<br>
<br>
1) JavaWorld did an article on the details of the diffs. It's
worth reading.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-10-1997/jw-10-sdk.html">http://www.javaworld.com/jw-10-1997/jw-10-sdk.html</a><br>
<br>
2) I rewrote my script to ignore overriden methods. If the
declaration<br>
changed, it's caught when we analyze the superclass, so all this
change does<br>
is reduce clutter in the output. The new diffs are available at<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.stinky.com/java/msdiff.txt">http://www.stinky.com/java/msdiff.txt</a><br>
<br>
3) In rewriting my script, I caught a big mistake: due to a
regular<br>
expression run amok, I missed analyzing java.lang.Class! As luck
would have<br>
it, that was a class with many changes... here they are:<br>
<br>
java.lang.Class:<br>
&gt; public java.lang.Class getInterface(java.lang.String);<br>
&gt; public java.lang.reflect.Method<br>
getDeclaredMethodFromSignature(java.lang.String,
java.lang.String);<br>
&gt; public java.lang.reflect.Method<br>
getMethodFromSignature(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);<br>
&gt; public java.lang.reflect.Method getMethods(int)[];<br>
</p>

<p>Sunday 12 October 9:08 AM EST</p>

<p>I just ran my script on Netscape's PR2 patch. Results are
still at<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
href="http://www.stinky.com/java/nsdiff.txt">http://www.stinky.com/java/nsdiff.txt</a><br>
<br>
Highlights:<br>
<br>
* Netscape does support JDBC and JavaBeans, contrary to my
previous report.<br>
<br>
* Netscape is still missing java.security.*<br>
<br>
* There are now about 27 extra public methods in 7 different
classes<br>
<br>
* none of them look particularly heinous, and are undocumented
and therefore<br>
easy to avoid (just like Microsoft's changes)<br>
<br>
* John Zukowski (author of the JavaWorld article referenced
above) recommends looking at protected methods as well as public
methods, since they are also visible outside the package. I'll be
updating my scripts soon and I'll keep you posted.</p>

<p><a name="rmi"></a>Thursday 16 October 1997</p>

<p><br>
So I ran my diff test on Microsoft's implementation of RMI that
they posted to their FTP site. (And then didn't tell anyone where
it was; I had to find out on Usenet.) <a
href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/unsup-ed/rmi.zip">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/unsup-ed/rmi.zip</a>
&nbsp; </p>

<p>Turns out Microsoft's public declarations and API have no
differences from Sun's inside java.rmi.*. &nbsp; That's because
they're the same files :-) &nbsp; </p>

<p>The class files themselves are *identical* to Sun's RMI class
files (from JDK 1.1.3). In fact, they've even got the same
creation and modification dates. They're the same files. &nbsp; </p>

<p>I hope to test them later today, to find out if they actually
work inside IE4 / MSJVM. &nbsp; <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="rmi-fails"></a>16 October 1997</p>

<p><br>
This just in: RMI doesn't work under Internet Explorer 4.0.<br>
<br>
It fails with a<br>
<font face="Courier">&quot;com.ms.security.SecurityExceptionEx[java/rmi/registry/LocateRegistry.&lt;clinit&gt;]:
Unable to access system property:
java.rmi.registry.packagePrefix&quot;</font><br>
inside the Naming.lookup() call.<br>
<br>
This is even if you go get<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/unsup-ed/rmi.zip">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/unsup-ed/rmi.zip</a>
and unzip it in your<br>
applet's codebase directory.<br>
<br>
Note that it works fine under Netscape 4.03 with JDK1.1 patch. It
also works<br>
fine with JView, the standalone JVM from Microsoft.<br>
<br>
It also works fine if you install java.rmi.* inside the classpath
on your<br>
local machine, so IE can find the code locally and trust it.<br>
