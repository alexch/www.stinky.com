I'M SITTING NEAR THE CENTER OF THE HOME THE FAMILY THAT MY INSECURE HEART 
CRAVES DAILY AS I WALK AND LOOK IN WINDOWS OF FLOWERY VINEY PORCH SWINGED 
HOUSES OF WHAT LOOK LIKE CREATIVE ARTISTIC FULL-FILLED PEOPLE THAT NEVER 
DO WORRY ABOUT WARMTH OR A STAGGERING LACK OF LOVE, BUT ABOUT WHAT COLOR 
PEACH TO PAINT THE BATHROOM AND MAYBE A NAME FOR THE SWEET NEW DOG.
<p>
What I find here scares me more than the cold more than alone more than 
total solitude forever. Stacks of unread art books but no easel anywhere + 
dusty 10 years old drafting board and the beginnings of a dream house 
unbuilt. Ugly furniture stands next to a priceless antique because its 
functional because the television has got to go somewhere. Childrens 
bedrooms stacked to the ceiling with plastic purple shit and a 
refridgerator stacked with dino fruit snacks and school lunch suppplies 
3 jars of peanut butter creative murder and alot of bills.
<p>
But I want to live in the biggest box of all I want to live only in the 
box that has no edges no corners no beautifully architected red houses 
with trim of white and skylights. my house is blue brown and green no roof 
and no corners to back into.
