What makes you think you are cool?<br>
What makes you take yourself seriously?<br>
Are you a member of AC-DC? NO? Well,<br>
Next time you take yourself and your silly life so damn<br>
Serious, say the magic words: Angus! Malcolm! Bon! Phill! Cliff!<br>
<br>
If you still feel important<br>
You may have to break out Highway to Hell, side 1 (play twice)<br>
