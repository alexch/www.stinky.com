<font size=+1><pre>Carnival of fun family life

Mean dad S.S. yells at the top of the stairs

Birds and fish shudder

Mom runs comforts self children pets dishwasher

Toilet overflow

Walls come down

Nice dinner split pea to calm nerves

Smear it all over your body and the walls

Of the sweet house so sweet fix the stove

Clean up your shit like I asked you to

Respect me now love me honor me

You get older and patterns begin to emerge
If you see them and they are all one color
or really ugly colors you would never paint a wall
consider greens and browns or white for awhile
