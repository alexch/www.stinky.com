I'd slide onto a barstool
Next to any Joe alone
ask him for a smoke
And a quarter for the phone
And does he still remember
How I like the rim
Of a glass
And when he parted me
Up the middle
How his hands stayed on my ass
And isn't it nice
I'm not his mother or his wife
And isn't it great
How we both drink it straight
But not sweer
Oh, let's just keep drinking!
I'll say
Those eyes I remember
But they're so sad today
