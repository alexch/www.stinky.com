bad breath !

Receive 100 FREE breath gel caps with your order !

Breath Refresh, is an ALL NATURAL product made of parsley seed oil and
sunflower oil in a gelatin capsule.

There's absolutely no difference from others on the market, EXCEPT THE
PRICE. If you've heard about this product or have used Breath Asure,
now you can buy the same all natural product direct from the source.
The savings are yours. They cost as low as $1.59 per 50 gel caps, or
$2.38 per 75 gel caps when you buy their best deal! Don't take my word
for it. Compare that to store prices! That's SAVINGS UP TO 50% to 70%
by buying direct !

Breath Refresh works internally through your digestive system which is
the source of most bad breath caused by foods that we all love, such
foods that contain garlic, onions, spices, etc. Other products such as
candy mints, sprays or mouthwashes only mask your breath for a few
minutes, whereas Breath Refresh attacks the problem at the source, the
stomach, and therefore lasts for hours and hours.

Now you can eat and drink what you want . . . when you want, and go
with the confidence that you'll always have fresh, clean breath. Just
take 2-3 gel caps before or after each meal and it goes to work in
20-30 minutes. You can repeat as often as you desire.

You can order with confidence. They have a 30 day money-back
guarantee! 

To order call 24 hours (800) 414-0785 or  !  visit their website at
