This page is so lame. The girl looks cute but you can't tell
cause it's so grainy. I hope you drank good beer, or at least
drank a lot of it, cause then at least you'd have an excuse.
Plus then you might look good to each other.
<p>
No actually I think you had a good time. Actually I <b>know</b>. :-)

I don't get it... If you were both blind... who took the
photographs?
<P>
If anybody ever says that <strong>"This page is lame!"</strong>
in a comment.... hmmm.... aren't <i>they</i> the ones who
are using it?
<P>
real programmers don't draw.  :)

I love it!  Chaffee ironically glorifies his sexual
frustration with the ultimate public medium - the net, as if
he is saying, "Look, I got dis cute chic all to myself in
front of a computer with a built-in camera."  He uses 
pseudo-silly-techno-flaunt to cover an overt act of worship. 
We jeer, but also can't help but cheer -- good luck Alex!!!! #8

Hey, Alex.  Finally got a chance to really
look through your pages, and I -love- this
one.  Don't know why, though.  Some kind of
odd tone to the words that makes it
readable, while if someone didn't see it
(but only knew what it was about), it might
be thought of as a candidate for
<A HREF="http://www.primus.com/staff/paulp/useless.html">The Useless WWW Pages</A>.
Funky.

Hellen,I'm not a real programmer.  I'm not even a fake one.  Does that mean I'm allowed to draw flowcharts now?a.hellP.S.  It's not **really** a flow chart.  It's actually a decision tree.

Decision Tree?

None

Flowchart, Gannt Chart, or Decision Tree...all I know is I'm
more confused by the time I get to the bottom of it, than I 
am when I start.
<P>
They have cable TV in New York, right.  Cuz that should
be in there somewhere.  And Haggan Daaz ice cream.
<P>
