<blockquote>
A mutual friend at Alex's work gives Alex's email address to
Alison. That very night, circa 10 pm, she surprises him with a 
talk request. 
<a href="talk.html">(Excerpts here.)</a>
He is distractable and paranoid, in the middle of chasing a
long-standing bug; she is in her normal state of mind: overworked,
overtired, overconfident and over the top. They get along like old
ward mates from the shell shock clinic.

Nice talking you last night. Sorry I couldn't talk longer; the good
news is I squashed that bug, hopefully once and for all, around 4 a.m.
It's been plaguing me for weeks, stalking me in my dreams, making me
nervous, whispering nasty things about me to my friends. Now I can go
for a walk in the park in unconflicted seasonal rapture. Or is that
just sleep deprivation?

So I was thinking. I can't remember the last time I went on a date
(that is, a Date date), and I've *never* had a blind one, but Lord
knows I need to meet more New Yorkers and if I swallow my blase and
butterflies it occurs to me that it would probably be a lot of fun.
Considering that your talking the initiative (so to speak) shows
you're at least thinking positive, I don't see why we need Diane to
chaperone. I don't have any plans this weekend. Do you? We could meet
somewhere geeky like the @ cafe and hang out for an hour or two.

Okay, time to go shake off the cobwebs, have a cup of coffee and read
Eightball.

<ul>

<li><b>Big Cup Caf&eacute;</b>, 21st and 8th Ave. Although she had
previously answered the question, <a href="talk.html">"Peppermint tea or latt&eacute;?"</a>
herbally, Alison opted for a cappuccino. This kept her right on in her
corporate-strategic-planner-for-the-Man mode, and within 10 minutes,
out comes the Sharpie, and Alex's entire life enters the Platonic
cuisinart that is Alison's mind. <a href="#flowchart">You can see the
results for yourself...</a> 

<li><b>Caffe Reggio.</b>  I think it's on Macdougal, just south of 3rd?
Alison ordered a banana. It was a perfect banana.

<li><b>Someplace geeky</b>.

We ended up at the <tt><a href="http://www.easynet.co.uk/pages/cafe/ccafe_us.htm#newyork3">@ cafe</a></tt>, which is
equipped with the latest cutting-edge romantic technology, including a T1, a
CUSeeMe reflector, QuickCams, and Pete's Wicked Summer Brew.

got the QuickTime movie to upload! If you've got the bandwidth for a 1-meg

Here's the flowchart she drew up of my decision to stay in New York (within the first 
15 minutes of meeting). With a Sharpie, on a napkin.<p>

You may have noticed a look of surprise briefly cross my face while I was
reading your wallet. It happened when I saw your full name for the first
time. This surprised me not via some narrative function -- e.g., my first
dog was the victim of a hit and run; as the Chevy Caprice with mismatched
fenders rolled away in a cloud of dust I squinted through my tears but all I
could make out was the vanity plate -- but because your full name
is a double dactyl.

</pre>
[ The explication of double dactyls has been excerpted and expanded;
you can learn all about them 
<a href="http://www.stinky.com/dactyl/">right here</a>. ]
<pre>

This is all by way of saying that this morning I awoke, I stared at my
ceiling, I remembered that your name qualifies you for the rare honor of
being memorialized in poetic form. Thirty minutes later I had the first
draft. Ten minutes ago, after a constructive conversation with my
abovementioned uncle ("It's not... *clever*.") I rewrote it, and the second
draft meets with his, and I hope your, strict lyrical standards. Without
further ado, I give you...
</pre>
<blockquote>
<b>	Full Spectrum</b><p>

	Hecubus, Shmecubus	<br>
	Stygian Alison		<br>
	Flees from a dizzying	<br>
	Visual blitz.		<p>

	"I've had enough of this	<br>
	Polychromatically	<br>
	varying scenery:	<br>
	<b>*Brown*</b> is the shits."	<br>
<br>
        - ADC
</blockquote><pre>

Note that "X is the shits" means "X is good" (an idiom with which my uncle
was unfamiliar). Note also that the title sucks and if you can think of a
better one please let me know.

Later...

<font size=-2><b>Note:</b> "Stygian Alison" does not follow the letter
of the law for selecting double-dactylic proper names; epithets are
only acceptable if the personage is known to the world under that
name; e.g. William the Conqueror or Stan "The Man" Meusiel. <b>But</b>
this is just a pseudonym anyway, and her true name, known only to a
select few, is indeed dactylic <i>in veritas</i>.
