<b>Alison:</b>
Mulder's Dad just got shot and in his dying breath, whispered "Forgive me."
<p>

<b>Alex:</b>
That's like my ultimate dad fantasy.    

<hr>

<b>Alex:</b>
I'm living as frugally as I can and still maintain my sanity. I consider my
sanity a utility.
<p>

<hr>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
I heard a guy in a diner today, late 60s, 34th street... No, just like
an immigrant, or possibly a tourist, Russian Jew or Solvenian, grey
flannel suit, ... He was leaning over to talk to an elderly couple in
the booth opposite mine, and he pronounced, with sage gravity:

<blockquote>
May is Mother's Day<br>
After August is school,<br>
then comes Christmas.<br>
</blockquote>

Poetry!

<b>Alison:</b>
Ok, how would you describe yourself in 25 words or less.

<p>

<b>Alex:</b>
I'm a metaphor looking for something to represent.
