  ch'io non avrei mai creduto
    che morte tanta n'avesse disfatta
                        -- Inferno, Canto III, 56-57

The first time I was at the World Trade Center was in grade school, on
a class trip in the 1970s.  I don't remember exactly when.  I do
remember going up to one of those tall, narrow windows on the
observation deck to look down at the city below, and being badly
startled when a loose floor tile gave a quarter of an inch underneath
my feet.  I thought I was going to plunge through the window.

The first memory I have of the WTC that wasn't lost in my childhood
haze was going to the Concourse level, probably sometime late in high
school, perhaps senior year.  We were geeky teens who had just
discovered a mall to meet at, lame though it might have been as a
mall.  I remember being surprised that this underground mall even
existed in Manhattan.

The time I worked there was in 1994, a year after the bombing.  This
was for one of my SIPA internships, and it was at some small Port
Authority group that did trade promotion for New York City.  That group
was re-orged away sometime in 1995, being vaguely silly in its scope.
Locally made beauty products being shipped to Asia?  I'd be surprised
if they ever shipped more than a pallet-ful of that.  This was only for
a semester, and we were in the north tower (WTC1), I think on the
30-something floor, and the reasonable PA cafeteria I got lunch in was
at least one Sky Lobby above us.  I'll always remember the thrill of
walking out of the Concourse and into the huge, magnificent lobby of
the tower.  Compared to the florescent-lit Concourse, it was filled
with light.

Over the years, like a lot of New Yorkers, I was in, out and around the
WTC.  It's where the Broadway IRT stopped downtown, where there was a
nice Border's bookstore, the first in Manhattan I think.  In 1993, I
worked at the city's Campaign Finance Board, down at Rector Street and
under the shadow of the Towers.  Over the past couple of years, I
returned a number of times to Windows on the World to set up trade show
laptops and LCT displays for Random Walk; these were probably the first
times I'd been above the 100th floor since elementary school -- New
Yorkers don't often go to tourist attractions, and I'd forgotten what
the view was like from up there.

I heard about the first plane when I was getting ready to go to work,
listening to radio.  NPR flickered with static for a moment, and
shortly after that the radio announcer said that a plane had struck the
Twin Towers.  I turned the TV on -- it was CBS, and was just as good as
any other channel -- and made some phone calls.  I thought it was a
Cessna, but the hole in WTC1 was too big.  Someone on NPR said it was
big, like a 757.  Shit, a lot of people must have died, probably a
couple hundred.  I turned away for a bit, and there was an explosion on
the second tower, and the TV announcers started gibbering in shock.
They rewound the live feed a few seconds, and there was another plane.
The camera angle they had was bad, and it look like a small, slow
moving plane.  I realize now that the 767 had approached from behind
the Tower, and the small line I saw was the wing peeking out from
around the side of the bulding.  But at the time, I thought it was, I
don't know, a police aircraft that was doing a survey of the damage on
the first tower that had somehow lost control and slammed into the
second tower, one awful accident after another.  I didn't realize that
the explosion I saw was the jet blasting through from one side to the
other.

I got through on the phone to work.  I was going to come in after the
first plane struck, thinking there'd be some disruption downtown, but
that'd be it.  I was told not to come in, and that a bunch of people
from the office were supposed to be at Windows on the World.  I went
back to watching TV, something I'd do for the rest of the day, sort of
for the rest of the week.

When WTC2 collapsed, I just stared.  I though the newscaster was making
a mistake, that the Tower was just behind that cloud of dust, that the
cloud of dust was kicked up by some secondary explosion from jet fuel,
something.  The dust cloud began to clear, and I still thought I could
see the Tower, a shadow in the cloud.  But that's all it was, a shadow
in the cloud.  I just sat and stared for minutes.

Grace came back early: she'd been in the Kings County ER, volunteering
to help with the flood of wounded.  People were sent away after 3PM,
because there just weren't any.  That night, I didn't feel like
cooking, so we went out to dinner in a Park Slope sushi place.  Walking
down Seventh Avenue, we could see a clear sky, except for cloud-like
plume of smoke from Manhattan.  There was a smell of burning in the
air.  That evening, the wind was blowing south.

We came into Manhattan for the first time on Wednesday afternoon.  We
took the Q train in -- the trains that go through the Financial
District weren't running.  When the train crossed the Manhattan bridge,
what little conversation in the subway car stopped, and everyone
quietly moved to the south side of the train and stared out the
windows.  Through the smoke, we could see the towers of the World
Financial Center, towers that we could never see from the bridge
before.

I had a bunch of newspapers from the previous week in my apartment that
I hadn't gotten around to reading yet.  I tried to read them, but wound
up throwing them out.  These were news stories about another world, now
gone.

I remember some statistic that was thrown around in the old world about
how it's more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to
be victim of international terrorism.  In this new world, every New
Yorker knows someone who knows someone who's been struck by lightning.
Every American knows someone who knows someone who did some sightseeing
at where the lightning struck.  I found out later that not everyone
scheduled to be at Windows on the World got there on time.  We haven't
heard from the two who were there.

I heard a funny comment yesterday: if there ever was a time to have a
gun-slinging Texan in the White House, this is it.  I don't believe we
can negotiate with people who have not reconciled themselves with the
end of the Caliphate and the arrival of Crusaders in the Holy Land, and
believe that mass murder will recall a golden age that passed before
the Pilgrims landed in Massachusetts.  This is a cancer that must be
cut out.  The conditions that allow this mentality have to be
addressed, but those possessed of this hatred of us for simply being
are probably beyond hope.  The cutting out has to be careful, so as not
to spread this cancer, but cut it out we must.  Hopefully, our policy
makers are up to that task.

I saw more American flags hanging from buildings in New York, hanging
from backpacks, purses and hats, than I've ever seen before.  Bin Laden
has called America a paper tiger that will crumple after a few blows,
and one of the Taliban recently proclaimed that these attacks have
turned the United States from a "superpower to a zero power".  This is
like what the fascists said in the 1930s.  I don't believe he and
others like him quite comprehend what they've set in motion, quite
understand the whirlwind they're about to reap.

Tomorrow, I'm going to make blueberry pancakes, and hopefully I'll
remember to spray the claims-to-be-nonstick griddle with Pam.

Subject: Back From London (a little long)
Date: Sun, 16 Sep 2001 14:12:01 -0400

Hi All,

Well, I finally made it back. I've been stranded in London by the events
of last week. I managed to get through to Steven and got his wonderful
answering machine message that he was okay. I think I left fairly
babbling messages on his and Christopher's answering machines. As was
everyone, I was a bit overwhelmed and emotional at that point. I had
spent most of the afternoon (UK time) trying to find out about a friend
of mine who gets off the subway at World Trade (and is also 7 months
pregnant) and her husband who I had put on a plane from the UK just that
morning. Thankfully both of them were okay, although as of last night he
was still in Newfoundland where they had diverted his plane. He's been
stuck living in an ice rink since Tuesday and hopes to get out today.

It was very surreal experiencing this in London. Everyone felt so
helpless and out of touch. The UK news stations did a great job of
reporting the events. CNN, ITN (or is it ITV) and Sky News all had links
to US stations as well as their own reporters. The people of London were
very supportive. They had dropped off flowers at the American Embassy
and there were lines to sign condolence books. They had a massive
memorial service at St Pauls. You couldn't get anywhere near the place
there were so many people. Earlier in the day they had a special
changing of the guards ceremony where they played the US National anthem
and other patriotic songs. We spent most of our time watching the news,
waiting to find out when we could go home. When we did venture outside,
Londoners were so kind when they realized we were from Manhattan, or
from anywhere in the US.

Flying into the city last night was also surreal. You could see a layer
of dust over the city and the cloud rising from the site. The security
arrangements at the airlines were very strict. You weren't allowed to
bring much hand luggage on the plane and what you had was thoroughly
searched. No razors, nail files, knitting needles etc were allowed. At
the gate the men and women had to form separate lines because they
patted everyone down. On the plane you just got plastic utensils, and
flimsy ones at that. The planes out of Gatwick were filled to capacity.
But my boss flew out of Heathrow and he said that there were some empty
seats.

I caught a taxi back into the city with someone who had been on vacation
in Florida. His office in one of the buildings surrounding the WTC. He
was somewhat freaked out by the experience of seeing it firsthand. Its
not like seeing it on the news.

It was great to hear from people on list. I didn't get internet access
until Thursday since the internet cafe near my hotel was down. It made a
big difference having this contact.

That being said, I hope to see you all soon. Nothing can replace the
experience of being together with your friends.

OK, it's Monday morning, and the office is getting back together.
My regular email server is running again, so there's no need to use the
Hotmail address I'd been on for the past week.  I'll check that address
occassionally, but not regularly.

The Financial District still smells like smoke, and there's a dusty haze.
There's a whole sequence of checkpoints when you come out of the subway
station (Broad Street off the J, this morning), where you present a
picture ID and a business card to the cops and National Guard.

Electricity -- we're west of Broadway -- appears to be supplied by
diesel generators parked outside the building.  We've been told to
minimize electrical use, and the building is only running the freight
elevator for now.  We're not sure when regular power will be restored,
but probably not soon.

Internet connectivity came up about an hour ago: our ISP upstairs needed
some three hours to get to the point where they could boot their systems,
so they could see if there were any real problems.  But there didn't
seem to be anything wrong: Cable & Wireless, their upstream, apparently
doesn't route through the WTC.

A few windows on the 13th floor were left open, and there's a fine
layer of dust on some of the desks, along with the smell of smoke.
We're moving everyone downstairs, so they can work.  There's a Coast
Guard cutter outside the window, anchored in the harbor near the place
where the Liberty Island ferry departs from.

That's basically it.  I'm going to get some food now.

Facing South
Nova Spivack
9/16/01

There is almost a feeling of guilt among the living, because it doesn't feel
right to be enjoying such lovely weather in the middle of such destruction
and national emergency. It is the end of summer and there is still warmth in
the air but also a slight pinch of autumn cool. It feels surreal to walk in
the sunny beautiful weather here right now; what a gorgeous day, yet at the
tip of the island there is a huge plume of smoke and thousands buried alive.
New York City has been totally transformed by this event.

The streets are full of emergency vehicles, FBI, national guard, police,
fire men, construction and telephone workers. Every few minutes an F16
fighter jet circles over the city on patrol. Large Navy helicopters thunder
overhead on the southern tip. Processions of police cars, FBI detectives,
motorcycles and special construction crews race southwards, sirens blaring.
Occaisionally, dust and debris covered rescue and police vehicles come north
as well. People stop on the streets and applaud when fire vehicles go by. A
large fire truck went by with a huge flag billowing above it, almost like a
parade float. Everyone is wearing the flag, either a pin, a ribbon or entire
flags on their clothes. Flags hang from the windows, from cars. Taxis and
shops, and in particular those owned by muslims and immigrants, are also
displaying the flag vigoriously, and in some cases one wonders if it is
because they are afraid of being targeted for revenge. Every TV and radio is
tuned to the news. Some people are buying supplies, others are out trying to
have a good time and forget for a while. There are many more people walking
around than usual, even for New York. Everyone is looking around in a
mixture of shock, awe, grief and fear. Every conversation is about the
disaster and the coming war. There are stories about miraculous escapes---I
have met many who were on the higher floors and somehow made it out, others
who survived simply because they were outside for a 10 minute smoke or a
coffee.

A few blocks from my apartment is the New York City Armory, where the
National Guard has set up a huge staging area for the relief efforts. Around
it are thousands of boxes of water and supplies for the rescuers. Hundreds
of people mob the area: the families and friends of those lost on their cell
phones seeking information, as well as curious onlookers and those simply
mourning the dead or watching the crowd itself. Tents full of international
TV crews and their equipment line the streets. Cables snake in gutters.
Police barricades and army troops try to keep order. Trucks with satellite
dishes and microwave antennas on them beam news stories around the world.
For several blocks around the walls of every building are lined with posters
by the families of the missing: thousands of xeroxes with color photos and
posters mixed with flowers that have been put there by those seeking
information, giving vital stats. There are wedding pictures, pictures of men
with their children, pictures of executives, firemen, police men,
secretaries, window washers, chefs, waiters, laborers, stock traders: all
sorts of people of all races and nationalities were lost in this tragedy. In
fact, the names and faces are more international than American. It was truly
an attack on the world, not just America.

Every bus stop, every telephone pole, the walls at St. Vincent's Hospital,
and other walls and store windows all over the city display the posters for
the missing---they are like gravestones, each one telling a story of a life,
a person, a family, a relationship. There are also impromptu memorials, with
candles and pictures and flowers on street corners, intersections, parks.
Little groups of people, passerbys, stop to think silently around them.
Every few blocks I see an anonymous woman crying alone, sitting in a cafe,
standing in a doorway looking south. People walk holding hands or putting
their arms around each other, happy just to have each other, appreciating
the simple things in life. The entire city is a shrine for the dead. It is
strange to have such horror right here in the greatest city on earth, it is
equally strange to suddenly see such a strong sense of community appear here
in this usually-cynical in insular city not known for its friendliness. Now
not only are strangers speaking to one another like old friends, they are
helping each other without reservations and everyone has the eyes of
compassion. It seems that this city has been brought closer together by what
happened. There is also a new energy of nationalism and patriotism that I've
never experienced in my life, and certainly not among my generation of
dot-com liberal 30-somethings. In a paradoxical way this attack has made the
fabric of this city, and this country, far stronger than it has ever been in
my lifetime. Instead of weakening us it has had an opposite effect.



At the same time, people are terrified, stressed out, disgusted, and the
anger, anxiety and sadness is only starting to hit some. A friend who has
been volunteering day and night at the Armory for 3 days suddenly called me
this morning and finally broke down on the phone; she had been the picture
of strength the whole time and only now, 6 days later has she finally
succumbed to the exhaustion and the stress. Others sit in cafes and
restaurants frantically discussing the scenario, wondering what is really
going on behind the scenes and what will happen when we respond, and after.
People are making contingency plans, where to go, how to escape further
trouble. Some fear further attacks by the terrorists, others fear what we
will do to the Arab world in response. World War III may be starting, but
its not going to be what we thought, it's going to be slow and painful,
there are going to be long excrutiating pauses punctuated by shocking and
unpredictable attacks, and it could take years, even decades before it's
over. Or it could be over in months, but I doubt it. It really depends on
how America retaliates and how effectively they do it. One thing is for
sure: there are a lot of Muslims in the world, the majority of whom are
innocent and peace-loving family-oriented people just like us and don't
deserve to be punished for the insane acts of a few suicidal extremists.

Are we capable of punishing those who are responsible without accidentally
destroying the lives and livelihood of millions of innocents in other
countries in the process? Furthermore, if we retaliate imprecisely and harm
too many innocents in the process will we not only martyr those who were
responsible but also polarize the entire Muslim world against the west,
including those who are currently our allies, moderate or politically
neutral? The fact is that many of the terrorists we currently must
face---Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and others---were originally trained
and armed by western-funded intelligence programs in the past. So we must
accept some of the responsibility for creating these monsters; we cannot
hold the Arab world solely responsible. At the very least we must avoid
sinking to the level of those who have attacked us and I pray that our
leaders will be thoughtful and measured in days to come. In this coming war
on terrorism, we must take care not to become terrorists ourselves.
Presently, as innocent victims, we have the moral high-ground in this
conflict: let's not lose it in a blind quest for revenge. At the same time
it is clear that we must respond with force as unfortunate as that may be.
Terrorism, like computer viruses, cannot be eradicated but it can be
limited: yet to succeed at this we must first disarm the world, especially
the rogue nations and terrorist groups. However, so long as selfish
governments and corporations are allowed to profit by indiscriminantly
arming any group that has the money to pay them, we will continue to
experience further problems, possibly far worse than those of last week.


</pre>For the last few days it has felt strange to be a New Yorker; the World
Trade towers were a fixture and a symbol of this city, and of the new world
economy. Without them the island of Manhattan feels different, lighter---but
not in a good way---but rather like it is missing something essential, a
part of our collective body. There is an acrid burning smell, like burnt
toast, in the air. People are quiet, thoughtful. This was once a happy,
carefree city, a city where everyone I knew had started an Internet company
and made a fortune, a city where people thought more about what they were
going to invest in or what they were going to wear out on friday night than
about what was going on in the rest of the world. It was a city that was
concerned mainly with money, fashion, culture, sex, fame, success, and
power---I am not saying that these are good things to be focused on, I am
simply saying that this was not a city that was concerned with fear,
tragedy, or loss. It was a city where we built things and never thought
about destruction or disaster. It was a place where it felt good to be
alive, where people had big dreams and big ideas and big offices, a place
where there was infinite potential to achieve one's goals, a place where
fortunes could be made and lost and easily made again. It was a place of
dealmaking and privelage, an island of wealth, an oasis of opportunity, and
also a maze of fun, nightlife, commerce and excitement. And it was a
multi-cultural place where people felt good immersed in the masses, the
multi-ethnic, multi-national sea of humanity---not a city where people
looked at each other with suspicion and dread. This was a city where going
out on the town was a joy, not a place where people wandered the streets
looking desperately for any news of their loved ones. Now the city feels so
different: it is a war zone. It is a casualty. It is a graveyard. These are
feelings that we have never felt about this place or in this place and it is
now a very different city to be sure.

The giant billow of smoke from the wreckage glows at night, illuminated by
the lights of the rescue effort, and rises into the sunny blue sky by day,
obscuring the tops of the other buildings like mountain peaks in the clouds.
You can see it from everywhere. And there is a strange gap in the skyline,
like missing teeth, teeth that have been punched out. Whenever I look south
I remember those unbelievable moments on tuesday morning when I woke up and
looked out my window to see the first tower on fire, then minutes later the
second tower exploding. Like everyone else who was here, I just couldn't
believe it was happening: it was like a bad dream, I actually wished I was
still asleep, but I wasn't. It was impossible to imagine even as it took
place before my eyes. There was nothing to do but stand there open-mouthed,
riveted to the south. I remember the intense orange color of the flames
coming from windows in the buildings, the thick smoke pouring from the
gaping holes where the planes went in. It just didn't look the same on TV:
the size and the colors were so much more real from here on the ground. And
then the collapse and the enormous mile-high cloud of smoke above, and the
millions of people walking uptown past my apartment to get away, people
covered in dust from head to toe, trucks bashed in and covered in ash and
debris. It was unreal, it was shocking. The scale of the disaster could only
really be understood if you saw it yourself.

Like so many others who live here and love this city, whenever I face south
now I can't help thinking about all the people who died down there under a
billion tons of rubble, and the many who are possibly still alive in the
buried underground mall complex and subway tunnels that the rescuers still
cannot reach, and in air pockets or crushed vehicles, starving, thirsty,
clinging to survival in the dark somewhere, not knowing what happened, not
knowing if anyone is coming to rescue them. I also can't help thinking about
where the world is headed now, the tragedies and struggles that lie ahead
for all of us. Many choices are being made now---by each of us, and by our
governments---that will set the course of our lives and those of millions or
even billions of others around the world for decades to come. Perhaps now,
more than at any time in the past decades, our destiny hangs in the balance.
In what may the last few weeks of relative peace for a long time, autumn is
coming slowly to New York and the last traces of summer linger for a while.
It really feels like the end of an era, the end of an innocence. In Arab
countries people face east when they pray. In New York City, we pray when we
face south.

From: Greg Elin


I've been down at the NY office of the Red Cross doing data entry.

More than 2400 (probably more than 3400, I just haven't seen them all)
have come in with offers of IT help.

I've read about people being moved by offers of help, but let me tell
you when you sit in front of a 2' pile of printed email message and
each one after the next is a pledge to get in a car and drive to NYC,
copy files to our server, send a team of certified technicians, send
100 laptops, sending 1 zip drive I saw you needed, can work all
weekend, whatever you need, I've authorized unlimited use of our
software, I'm not an MCSE but am ready to help, can send wire monkey,

it is overwhelming.

Then you go down to the cafeteria and you see a cookie
and a brownie in a little plastic bag with a note from a Girl Scout saying
thanks
and here's a treat for you and you know she probably thinks she is
sending it to a rescue worker and you are just doing data entry of a
thousands of "spontaneous volunteer form DR #784" who all came in or
signed up over the web and each person is just as eager as you to do
something.

it is overwhelming.

Then you go outside and you walk by a firehouse where cabbies have
started giving free rides home to people coming out of the Red Cross
at night and you walk by a firehouse where people have just come and
dropped off flowers and thank you's and you can see from across the
street what you know just from the shape now must be pictures of
missing persons,

it is overwhelming.

Then you come back at night and read that a few people are still
talking on your email list and more things are showing up online and
you just want to do everything you know how to do all at one time just
to help because you saw your friend Deborah who actually went down to
the ZONE and hugged firemen after you find out that the quiet Japanese
woman who came into to data entry with your friend Gen was on the 50th
floor of the first tower and you learn that about 1/4 of the company
including the executives of the Japanese company where she as American
staff because of her green card stayed behind and are among the
missing

it is overwhelming.

Heartening and horrifying is the fact this will continue to touch all
of us more and more and we will have more and more opportunities to do
our best of making ourselves useful.

I expect to learn tomorrow of more efforts and be able to get back to
you all with the direction things here in New York are beginning to
take for the IT response.

best,

Greg

Hello all kind humans who know what love is,

    While teaching one of my 8th grade science classes, I heard a plane
hit one of the Trade Center buildings. I let my students look out the
window as I did and we saw one tower with smoke rising. I made my
students return to their seats and calmed them. One plane may have been
an accident. All else was rumor then. The next student who came in said
another plane had hit the other tower. There was no more illusion of an
accident.
    While they looked again at the ever expanding, now giant plume, with
two towers puffing away like cigars standing on end, one was there and
then gone. They ran to me and said, "Mr. Zorn! Mr. Zorn! The Tower just
fell down! The World Trade Center fell down!" I figured the excitement
had escalated into pulling my leg. Who could accept the notion of a
World Trade Center Tower falling. At this point it was best to keep the
children seated and lower the blinds to curtail panic and excitement.
Refreshingly, there was none of the former and a reasonable amount of
the latter. I remember before my shades were pulled down, seeing the
remaining tower's glow and rapidly enveloping smoke. That was the last I
saw of the last World Trade Center tower. My students were accurate
observers, even in the face of disaster. The grade is A+ for that day,
clearly immortalized.
    We had to be mindful and keep the discussion of safety going. I was
reasonably sure that a school in Brooklyn was one of the safest to be. I
think my kids appreciated hearing that. From Park Slope, lower Manhattan
was rapidly consumed by the expanding smoke screen; soon I could not see
Manhattan at all. It was snowing ash, some shiny, some dull white. All
of it abrasive. First there was a flurry then enough to choke and blind.
We closed the windows from the acrid smell of fire and grit. One poetic
student said it was as if they saw glass floating in the sky above our
heads, glistening debris, came all this way with terror, sadness and
utter disbelief.
    Appropriate procedures were further implemented and I was so
reassured by our collective strength and resolve. Students and school
staff, alike. There was talk, rumor and tears but calm was maintained
with the warmth of those who could guide and console, and keep it real
during the seemingly unreal. The sensitivity of even the most
troublesome children was heartwarming. In each others presence, in spite
of the terrible mystery before us, there was sweet solace.
    By the time all the students were picked up and dismissed, to exit
into the equally surreal, by contrast, now clear sky of blue, most were
numb and unsure what this all meant. We all wanted to get home to our
loved ones. I was able to get from Brooklyn to New Rochelle in an hour
and fifteen minutes from the normal forty-five. My car was now a
military vehicle. My father, a Colonel in the New York Guard was
mobilized, as all military and support organizations were.
    My dial-up internet was available for about 20 minutes when I got
home and then down and it was up for 15 minutes today and then useless
again. I had a few news broadcasts on the TV, the thankfully
irrepressible radio stations and a brief e-mail download from so many
generous and concerned friends. Thank you for your generosity and
information.

    As a New Yorker, I always felt that when the ground shakes, we shrug
it off as we would another passing train. Big train, major derailment
and Vesuvius seems dim by comparison. Our foundations are in tumult and
many would concur, we have perhaps the worst President for this
situation, but we are all still Americans, and most of our government
and military is assuredly smart and strong. Together, we must lend
support to each other?s weakened knees. Grasp another's elbow and hold
on to the reality that this is one world and such a shutter is felt
here, around the world and back again. When we fall, we rise again
higher, as all will see.

    There is still no place I would rather be. Although, as we must all
be where we know and have love, there is a wealth of love elsewhere in
the world, feeling as we feel. We must be reminded that when we share
love, we can all feel glee. We now share the whole, free world's fear.
Hope and peace are our ally's; terror is everyone's enemy. There is
always need for renovation and rebuilding to be done, but true freedom
can never be made to crumble or erode. As Americans we look at the ever
present promise to be fulfilled, not a disaster, for our reason to be.
Love is our mortar and the bricks we will remake with our collective
hands, historically, even if on our knees.

Through this pain, together we will find the strength,
Let yourself cry if you have to and hold another willingly.
Mourn those brave innocents and those who were brave concertedly.

Think not of the cowards who will find no heaven waiting
or benefit from their demonic tendencies

Know the future can be kind to all,
for those kind, will find it deservedly.

Love
Charles Alexander Zorn
