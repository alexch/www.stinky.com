<li><a href="http://wtc.nac.net/">http://wtc.nac.net/</a> has cached

the buildings. :-(

<li>I've set up a <a href="thankyou/">mirror of
http://thankyou.fast-networks.net/</a> on this site.  It's got some
heartwarming pictures (as well as some that are just silly -- the
winner is the crying eagle black velvet montage).

shows the view from a satellite -- you can zoom in and out on lower
	Manhattan -- it gives a good sense of perspective to the scale
	of the damage
