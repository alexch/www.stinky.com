<br><br>I need to thank everyone here.  I have received over 10,000 emails
in the first four days of having this page online.  I want you to know,
 even though I may not respond to all of them, I am personally
reading each and every single one of them, but it is taking a very long
time.  I am so deeply touched by your gratitude and the emotions you have
all shared with me.  Thank you SO much for your love and support!<br><br>

If you have other touching and positive images showing
support for America during this time of hardship, please mail me <a href="mailto:tsk@killer.gaschamber.net">here</a>!
Feel free to email comments or corrections to the same address.

Thank you, and God bless.<br>
