From: "David Olson" <xxx@mindspring.com>  

Hey, all.
  
I've just gotten back from the Javits Center, the staging area for the
bulk of the relief work effort.  They are sending almost no more
rescue volunteers in today; NYPD, NYFD, and a few Ironworkers.  I even
talked to some out of town fire fighters who were told to come back
tomorrow, and/or simply to go home.

There is, however, a plethora of food and clothing piling up, so make
sure you have FIRST HAND info about what is and is not needed at this
time before bringing donations down.  I am not trying to stop people
from donating...we all want to do something, and donations can
certainly help.  It may be prudent to wait a day or two, however, once
they start letting more laborers down who will can use the food,
etc....  By the time they sent us all home today (after I sat on a bus
with a bunch of steel workers for an hour, thinking we were going
down) the situation had been reduced to mostly volunteers handing out
coffee and sandwiches to each other.  The workers were wondering out
loud what they would do with all the perishable food.

One of the biggest problems at the Javits Center yesterday was crowd
control; there were just too many people showing up wanting to help,
and they were getting in the way of police cars and emergency
vehicles.  Also, the police are apparently having many, many problems
with people showing up below Canal trying to help with search and
rescue or to give donations (food, clothing, etc...)  the workers.

I don't pretend to know the full story at all times, and the situation
can change quickly, but my experiences over the last two days at the
Javits Center have made me feel that posting this viewpoint might be a
good idea.  I'm sure there will be plenty of need for help and more
donations...let's just make sure we're helping and not getting in the
way.

For anyone who lives in NJ, it may be convenient and faster to donate

items needed by rescue workers to Rutgers University. Rutgers will
then deliver these items quickly. Below is what's needed, where to
bring, etc.

those in our community who have lost or are searching for loved ones
in the wake of this tragedy.

The hospitals in both New York and the Bay Area are overwhelmed with
blood donors.  They are especially looking for "Universal Donor" blood
(Type O, especially Type O Negative), but have been turning people
away even with type O.  Your best bet now is to plan to donate
tomorrow.

* Email groups warn of terrorism-related scams online

SAN FRANCISCO -- September 12, 2001 -- Email protection and consumer
advocacy groups warned today of online attempts to fraudulently
profit from yesterday's attacks on the USA. These attempts are taking
the form of unsolicited e-mail ("spam") and postings in community
forums, soliciting "donations" in the name of victims of the attacks.

A typical message claims to be part of an "Express Relief Fund" or
"Victims Survivor Fund". One message claims that donations will go to
the Red Cross, but the donation link leads to a Web site unconnected
with that organization.

...

The Red Cross is a legitimate organization active in supporting
victims of the tragedy and their families. To donate, visit their
official Web site (http://www.redcross.org) or call 1-800-HELP-NOW.
If you have trouble reaching the Red Cross directly, donations are
also possible online through PayPal at <http://www.paypal.com> and
Amazon <http://www.amazon.com>.

hi alex,

the officers who are working the streets are really hurting for
water, gatorade type drinks, sandwiches within the next couple hours
so that they can keep working. of course everyone should continue to
donate to the red cross, to the relief workers, to the families and
everyone else involved but there's also so many officers out there
who need our help. Really, if anyone can just walk outside his/her
home and bring them something if they have anything it is so much
appreciated by them.

riva



one last thing-- the red cross at 17 gramercy park is looking
specifically for socks and sweat pants (or at least they were when I
was there a few hours ago). They have no clothing for survivors to
wear home from the hospital.

if anyone does feel like they want to speak about their experience
they can reach me on my mobile - 917.714.9777.

On TV, Rudy Guiliani named three sites to give blood at:
<ul>
<li>153 E. 53rd St.
    
<li> 66th & Amsterdam (Red Cross)
    
<li> 310 E. 67th St.
</ul>

<hr>

Matt Grosso:

<pre>A word on giving blood:

    - you must bring a picture id, and you must prove 17< your age <65.

    - if you have any tattoos they will not let you contribute [ --
    nor if you are a gay man]

    - they especially need O or O- type blood. if you have that blood
    type go now.

    - if you don't have O or O-, consider waiting till tonight or
    tommorrow, as the blood donation centers are very overloaded and
    everybody wants to help. I went to two hospitals and a donation
    center and there are large throngs around all of them.

One note on donations:

Amazon has a $50 per/donation limit. I believe this to limit their
liability caused by credit card charges.

[I think it's $100 now. -A]

PayPal is taking unlimited donations AND if you have bank account
linked in you can avoid sending ANY money to the Credit Card
companies.

So if you want to give more than $50 (and as over-paid technology
people, I think most of us can afford more than $50), go to PayPal!

Jeff
