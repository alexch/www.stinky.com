I need to thank everyone here.  I have received nearly 2,000 emails<br>
in the first 24 hours of having this page online.  I want you to know,<br>
 even though I may not respond to all of them, I have personally<br>
read each and every single one of them, and I am so deeply touched<br>
by your gratitude and the emotions you have all shared with me.  Thank<br>
you SO much for your love and support!<br><br>

<font size="4">
If you have other touching and positive images showing<br>
support for America during this time of hardship, please mail me <a href="mailto:tsk@gaschamber.net">here</a>!<br>
Feel free to email comments or corrections to the same address.
<br><br>
Thank you, and God bless.<br>
Ryan (Tsk)
