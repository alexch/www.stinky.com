LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Striking a macabre note, a new album cover by
hip-hop band The Coup -- whose music has a strong anti-capitalist
bent -- had until recently depicted the World Trade Center exploding,
the band's label said Wednesday.

``We changed the artwork as soon as we saw what had happened,'' said
Daria Kelly, director of sales for 75 Ark, the band's label.

Kelly said the picture, which eerily shows group member ''Boots''
Riley holding a detonator in front of the exploding towers, was
yanked from the San Francisco-based company's Web site at
(http://www.75ark.com) by 9:30 a.m. PDT on Tuesday, hours after two
hijacked airliners actually smashed into the World Trade Center's
twin towers and brought them down, possibly causing thousands of
deaths.

FYI, this Nostradamus quote is bogus.  From
<a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa091101b.htm">http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa091101b.htm</a> :

Unfortunately, Nostradamus died in 1566, so it's rather unlikely he
wrote this passage in 1654. The quatrain is not to be found in his
published oeuvre. It's a hoax.

...

Nostradamus did not write the quatrain now being attributed to
him. (One wonders how a guy who died in 1566 could have written an
item identified as being penned in 1654 anyway.) It originated with a
student at Brock University in Canada in the 1990s, appearing on a web
page essay on Nostradamus. That particular quatrain was offered by the
page's author, Neil Marshall, as a fabricated example to illustrate
how easily an important-sounding prophecy can be crafted through the
use of abstract imagery. He pointed out how the terms he used were so
deliberately vague they could be interpreted to fit any number of
cataclysmic events.

...

In this case, a very few words actually written by Nostradamus have
been creatively enhanced by person(s) unknown. Notice the addition of
a reference to a "third big war" to the passage already
circulating. Pure bunk.

      altogether -- oops :-)
