<h3>Odyssey</h3>

higgledy piggledy<br>
wily Odysseus<br>

tricker of Troy<br>

polytaraxia<br>
finally came home to his<br>
wife and his boy.<br>

I'm enjoying working with this form, but I find that (despite my Texas
education) I'm having a hard time being funny and obscene. So I ask myself: is
this a gender thing? Is there something inherently masculine about the
traditional obscene double dactyl?

D. Arnson SVAR-li-en<br>
finds that this genre just<br>
isn't her thing;<br>
<p>
is it because of its<br>
phallocentricity--<br>
most of hers seem to be<br>
lacking their sting?<br>
