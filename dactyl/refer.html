<Blockquote> This page uses the HTTP_REFERER cgi variable to discover
who around the Web has put links to <a
href="http://www.stinky.com/dactyl/">double dactyls</A> 
on their
own pages. To do it yourself, put a script <a href="index.cgi.txt">that looks like this</a> in your directory as <tt>index.cgi</tt>. You must be running Apache or a smart HTTPD that knows to run index.cgi scripts.
