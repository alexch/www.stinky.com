[this message has a dangerously high nerd quotient]

Guy L. Steele, Jr, formerly of the MIT AI Laboratory, subsequently
Thinking Machines Inc and most recently Sun Microsystems, used to
write a lot of these, on generally nerdy subjects (so frequent
reference to the Hacker's dictionary may be necessary), both in
English and Latin. He called them "Higgledy-Piggledies".

The file I took these from is dated April 17, 1979. (There's a lot of
other even more nerdy stuff in it; perhaps similarly to the
relationship between science fiction fandom and computer science,
there's something of a "filk" tradition in CS, which this stuff
exemplifies.)

The original file contained a copyright notice: "(C) Copyright 1978 by
Guy L. Steele Jr.  All rights reserved." It's something I retreived
long ago from a venerable, now defunct, machine at the MIT AI Lab,
running the venerable, now defunct, Incompatible Timesharing System.

Oh, btw, Steele (or "GLS", pro. "gliss") was known at MIT as The Great
Quux, for reasons to complex to explain... hence the "quuxity" in
these, plus at least one reference to "TGQ".

[3] Some Higgledy-Piggledies


For those  not familiar with this verse  form: A Higgledy-Piggledy has
eight lines.  All but the  fourth and eighth lines are double dactyls,
while  the fourth and eighth  are a dactyl plus  an upbeat.  The first
line is nonsense; the second, a  name; the sixth must be a single six-
syllable  word;  and  the   fourth  and  eighth  must  rhyme.   It  is
permissible  for the first line  to make sense, or  for the fifth line
instead of the sixth to be  all one word.  If too many rules are bent,
the  verse  is  just  called a  double-dactyl  verse,  rather  than  a
Higgledy-Piggledy.

[a] If you write (DO ((X NIL X) ...) ...) instead of the
    usual (DO ((X NIL) ...) ...), i.e. you explicitly step
    a variable by its own value, NCOMPLR (the MacLISP compiler)
    may get confused, and in any case generates inessential code.

Higgledy piggledy,
Project MAC NCOMPLR
Still is committing its
DO-stepping sins:
Though it may seem somewhat
Counterintuitive,
FOO stepped by FOO screws; de-
Faulting it wins.


[b] You can't do EQ on numbers and hope to win.  Recall also
    the famous test in which NCOMPLR produced better numerical
    code than the DEC FORTRAN compiler (Fateman 1973).

Quaxity quuxity,
MacLISP and NCOMPLR
Have a convention that
Makes losers freak:
Integers allocate
Hyperefficiently,
Bettering FORTRAN, but
Screwing up EQ.


[c] As usual, taking a DWIM view of InterLISP.

Quaxity quuxity,
Teitelman's InterLISP
Has a DWIM feature that's
Really a screw;
MacLISP has evident
Superiority,
Letting its customer
Mean what he do.


    Though NEWIO has been around for many months,
    few people use it.  I wonder why?

Quaxity quuxity,
TGQ's NEWIO
Has many functions that
No one can grok:
Documentation is
Incomprehensible;
GLS will explain it, but
Still it's a crock.


[a] NIL leads a double life in LISP.

Quaxity quuxity,
NIL the atomic one
Acts like a wavicle,
Seemingly twin:
Not just the inverse of
Verisimilitude;
Also the inverse of
Where lists begin.


[b] I am getting weary of bicentennial parading by industry.
    "Bicentennial Minutes" now appear not only on television,
    but on milk cartons and beer cans.

Quaxity quuxy, A-
Merican businessmen
Use bicentennial,
Profit to gain.
Hope by the time we reach
Quadricentennial
They'll not so plague me -- ad-
Vertisements pain!


[c] For SF fans: see Asimov's article on the "peace bomb"
    (contained in his collection "Opus 100").

Quaxity quuxity,
Young Isaac Asimov
Strange thiotimoline's
Secret unfurled.
Cascaded series of
Endochronometers
Brought paradoxical
Floods on the world.

[d] More SF, this time in memory of James Blish:

Quaxity quuxity,
Blish used philosophy
When he was writing "The
Quincunx of Time."
Beeps of Dirac used to
Chronocommunicate
Fostered determinate
Free will sublime.

[e] DJL, computer science type undergraduate, has decided to
    go to MIT grad school in Materials Science.

Quaxity quuxity,
David J. Littleboy
(MIT graduate)
Makes his plans plain.
Leaving the study of
Data-technology,
He prefers seeking ma-
Terial gain.

[f] I once read that space has three dimensions because orbits
    aren't stable in 4-space.

I often have wondered in
What kind of orbit a
Planet proceeds in a
Tesseract space?
Multidimensional,
Hyperelliptical,
Dizzying spacemen in
Trans-solar chase.


[g] Finally, let's hear it for quantum mechanics, who service
    small automobiles for today's nuclear family.

Pauli and Heisenberg
Offer two rules for con-
Fused aristocracies,
Quantum domains:
"Egalitarian
Nonexclusivity
Must be forbidden"; "Un-
Certainty reigns."


[a] When in Canada, do as the Canadans do...

Quaxiti quuxiti,      Quaxity quuxity,
Remus et Romulus        Remus and Romulus,
Gemini fratres a        Wolf-nourished brothers, were
Lupa aluntur.           Twins, so they say.
Romulus inquit: non     Romulus patiently
Aedificabitur           Founded a city; as
Paucis diebus, sed      He said, "Rome will not be
Roma nascetur.          Built in a day."


[b] Apples grow on trees, but no trees in APLs.

Quaxity quuxity,
Kenneth E. Iverson
Made APL, matrix
Hackers to please,
Not only famous for
Arithmeticity;
Also for characters.
(Wish it had trees!)


[c] Sussman built a hacker for a Ph.D. thesis.  When will someone
    for a thesis build a hacker that builds a hacker?

Quaxity quuxity,
Gerald J. Sussman made
HACKER so famous for
Loopholes it plugs.
Armed with its knowledge of
Entomological
Manifestations, it
Ferrets out bugs.


[d] It doesn't take truth to destroy a reputation, but only
    a rumor.  Yet sometimes the nastiest rumor is the truth.
    Consider the one which says EQUIV causes true values (1-bits)
    to complement bits of the other argument...

Quaxity quuxity,
XOR's more famous than
Brother EQUIV, though they've
Similar use.
Uncomplementary
Verisimilitude,
Rumor undoubtedly
Cooked EQUIV's goose.


[e] And why did Napoleon clutch his stomach?  (Mail $1000 and a
    self-addressed, stamped envelope, and we'll send you a jingle
    in 25 words or less.)

Quaxity quuxy, Na-
Poleon Bonaparte
Conquered all Europe, but
What was the use?
Some say the problem was
Megalomania;
Others, he lacked modern
High-platform shoes.


[f] People got excited about BNF, and used it to drive parser
    generators.  But you still can't really tell how to write
    programs in the language.

Quaxity quuxity,
Backus's BNF
Drives a preprocessor,
Generates code.
Parsing is specified
Metasyntactically;
Writing it's easy, but
reading, I'm snowed.
