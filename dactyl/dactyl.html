<p><a name="description"></a>A dactyl, as you may know, is a
poetic foot of the form <font face="Courier">&gt;--</font>
(ON-off-off). For example, interstate, realize, microphone,
cereal, limerick, etc. etc. A double dactyl, naturally enough, is
two dactyls in a row.</p>

<p>A double dactyl is also a poem, a form invented by <a
href="hecht.html">Anthony Hecht</a> and Paul Pascal. Quite like a
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mgh1001/limericks.html">limerick,</a>
it has a rigid (if peculiar) structure. Two stanzas, each
comprising three lines of dactylic dimeter followed by a line
with a dactyl and a single accent. The two stanzas have to rhyme
on their last line. The first line of the first stanza is
repetitive nonsense. The second line of the first stanza is
somebody's name -- strictly speaking, a proper noun. Note that
this name must itself be double-dactylic. E.g. Gloria Vanderbilt,
Jesus of Nazareth, Gilbert and Sullivan, Archangel Gabriel. In
the second stanza, one entire line must be a double-dactylic
word. E.g. biopsychology, geopolitical, gastrointestinal,
abecedarian, etc. etc. There are a few more rules but here's an
example, based on the inventor of microscopy, Anton Von
Leewenhoek (whose surname is pronounced
&quot;LAY-ven-hook&quot;). </p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>Small Problem</h3>
    <pre>Higgamus Hoggamus
&quot;Anton Von Leewenhoek
Has a small problem,&quot; con-
Fided his wife.

&quot;Microbiology
Doesn't disturb me; his
Microanatomy's
Blighting my life!&quot;
</pre>
    <p><a href="mailto:uncleted@webtv.net"><cite>Theodore L.
    Drachman</cite></a><cite> </cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This actually goes above and beyond the call of double
dactylic duty; note that he uses two dd's in the second stanza
when all he really needed was one. Note also that, like a
limerick, it should be clever -- there should be a punchline. And
it should, of course, have something to do with its subject. </p>

<p>The definitive double dactyl reference is <cite>Jiggery-Pokery:
A Compendium of Double Dactyls,</cite> <a href="hecht.html">Anthony
Hecht</a> and <a href="hollander.html">John Hollander</a> eds.,
Athenaeum New York, 1967. Some of the following poems are lifted
without permission from that book. </p>

<p>In the introduction to <i>Jiggery Pokery</i>, pp. 14-22, the story
of the invention of the form is told in full. Janet Pascal writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[T]he inventors are Anthony Hecht and Paul Pascal (my
    father) with a little help from Naomi Pascal (my mother). The
    form arose when the two of them were resident at the American
    Academy in Rome, and my father pointed out that
    *schistosomiasis*, being dactylic, did not work as a line in
    an otherwise iambic poem. - <cite>Janet B. Pascal </cite><a
    href="mailto:pascal@panix.com"><cite>pascal@panix.com</cite></a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this I can add that <a href="mailto:tldrach@webtv.net">my
uncle</a> always told me that schistosomiasis was a fatal disease for
which there is only one cure, which is <b>also</b> fatal. </p>

<p>Here's a great self-referential example of the form by <a
href="mailto:robison@texas.net">Roger L. Robison</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>Double-Dactyl</h3>
    <p>Long-short-short, long-short-short<br>
    Dactyls in dimeter,<br>
    Verse form with choriambs<br>

    Hexasyllabically<br>

    Don't have the time.</p>

        and answers: &quot;I'm enjoying working with this form,
        but I find that (despite my Texas education) I'm having a
        hard time being funny and obscene. So I ask myself: is
        this a gender thing? Is there something inherently
        masculine about the traditional obscene double
        dactyl?&quot;</li>
