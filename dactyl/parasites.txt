Hello!

I teach high school biology, and I've introduced double dactyls to my
students to hook their interest and to stir their imagination.  Here are
a few that I wrote to illustrate the form and to introduce the topic of
parasites and pathogens.  The kids enjoy them and have tried the form on
their own.  I hope you enjoy them, too.
