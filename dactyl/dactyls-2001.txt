Omni magazine ran a double dactyl contest and published the results in its 
November 1980 issue.  According to the article, they received 5,000 entries.  
One of mine (about Mt. St. Helen's -- Yakima, Washington) was a runner-up.  I 
have been thinking about double dactyls since Esquire magazine published its 
piece on them about 35 years ago.  The one about Marcus Antonius was among 
Esquire's examples.

If you do not have access to the Omni winners, send me fax number information 
and I will send the pages showing the 30 winning poems.

Hi!
I enjoyed reading your webpage on double dactyls, and naturally was up
till the small hours the following night testing some out.
With just a little bit of rearranging of the files in your web
directory, you could have a self-referential higgeldy-piggeldy URL:

http://www.stinky.com/alex/higgeldypiggeldy

H-t-t P-colon,
Forward slash, Forward slash,
Double-u, Double-u,
Double-u, Dot
S-t-i, N-k-y
Dot com slash, Alex slash
higgeldypiggeldy
“What hath God wrought!”

I realize the rhythm is a bit forced in the first line, but that's the
best I could do.
You'd have to create a directory called "higgeldypiggeldy" and put your
higgeldypiggeldy document in that directory, naming it "index.html", or
whatever works on your server as being the default document to display
for a particular directory.
"What hath God wrought", of course, was the first [official] telegraph
message, and the first self-referential higgeldypiggeldy URL is an
equally momentous occasion in history.  For some of us.  I guess.

Use it in good health,
Mark O'Bannon

Alex,

What a wonderful collection of double dactyls.  I'll be looking back 
at them from time to time.

I notice your last updates appear to be a good sixteen months or so 
old, so I hesitate to push that enter-your-email-address button. 
I'll be encouraged if this send doesn't bounce, though.

Anyway, if you're still up for a good dactyl chuckle or two, here's a 
cut-and-paste of a few of my own.

[Note: Heliogabalus was a particularly dissolute Roman emperor 
(203-222 C.E.) who led a Syrian cult based on a meteorite, ate 
ostrich brains and sponsored orgies.]

---------------

Hippo-by-potamus
Heliogabalus
Worshipped a bolide and
Married four wives.

Bawdy proclivities,
Hyperactivities,
Prompted his courtiers to
Vent him with knives.

----------------------------------------------

Pipoulos-popoulos
Theotokopoulos
Known as El Greco, a
Painterly dude.

Armchair historians,
Demi-folklorians,
Took as a given his
Vision was skewed.

----------------------------------------------

Splishety-splashevich
Slobo Milosevic
Brash as a tsarevich,
Statesman manque.

Moral duplicities,
Ethnocentricities;
Now those galoshes are
Stomping HIS way.

----------------------------------------------

Nickety-noodleski
John Paul the Secondski
Polish pontifical
Primate sublime.

Faithfuls to catechize,
Heroes to canonize;
Ecclesiastical
Chores take his time.

Hi Alex,

A friend asked me to write a double-dactyl and as I wasn't 100% up to
snuff on the form, I did a search and hence found myself at your
website. You've got a super collection of poetry and your explanaition
of the for helped me greatly. I thought you may enjoy my effort. The
subject is a bit esoteric, geared toward hardline Frank Zappa fans, but
I think the piece stands on its own.....

Here ya go:

Flubbadee Blubbadee
Greggory Peccary
a fictional man that
Zappa supplied,

Looked like a piggie with
Respectability
Defined by the wearing
of big wide white ties

Thanks for the help! :o)

Great collection!  However, you omit The Greatest Of Them All (to my mind;
unfortunately I don't know the author):

	Said Agatha Christie to
	E. Phillips Oppenheim,
	"Who is this Hemingway?
	Who is this Proust?

	Who is this Vladimir
	Whatchamacallum, this
	Neo-post-realist
	Rabble?" she groused.

There's something about that last line that *sings*.  Also, incorporating the
nonsense line *into* the content is an excellent feature.

Aaron J. Dinkin here - noticed your webpage and quite enjoyed it. And,
since I'm sort of a deuterodactylist too, I saw no reason not to submit:

ESTABLISHING DOMINANCE

Twiddledum, twiddledee -
Ludwig van Beethoven
Hopes his new symphony
Isn't a bore;
Therefore he's started it
Heterodoxically,
Thrilling the crowd with five-
Seven of four.

[Author's note: This is a music theory joke, obviously. In traditional
Classical music, a piece always begins with a statement of the tonic chord
of the piece. Beethoven's first symphony breaks this tradition: it's in C
major, but it begins with the dominant-seventh (i.e., a "five-seven")
chord of the key of F (which is "four" in relation to C) instead.]


DISAPPOINTMENT

Basia, basia,
Ellen DeGeneres,
Old Latin poetry
Really is great.
Reading Catullus's
Hendecasyllables,
Don't get excited, 'cause
Lesbia's straight.

[Note: Lesbia was the girlfriend of the Roman poet Catullus, to whom many
of his love poems were dedicated.]


A CHANGE OF FORMAT

Higgledy-piggledy,
Benjamin Harrison
Listened to poems and
Said, "Okey-dokey,
Leave me alone with your
Dactylic meter; it's
Unsatisfactory.
I like trochee.
