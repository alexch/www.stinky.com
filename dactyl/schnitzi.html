&gt;       BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - A television station has had a change of
&gt; heart about ``Ellen.''
&gt;       In April, WBMA was the only ABC affiliate in the nation that
&gt; refused to air the episode of ``Ellen'' in which the central
&gt; character, played by Ellen Degeneres, announced she was a lesbian.
&gt; It also refused to air subsequent episodes in which she told
&gt; friends and relatives she was gay.
