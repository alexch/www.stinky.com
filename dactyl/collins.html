<a href="mailto:bcollins@comox.island.net">Barrie Collins</a> has
created a huge number of poems in his<a href="#gender">(*)</a> first
week or two after learning of the wonder and joy of dactylitry.

                        Hedonist feminist
                        Sappho the Poetess
                        Wrote double-dactyls each
                        Day by the ton.

                        Ain't it a pity her
                        Sesquipedalian,
                        Double-dactylian
                        Doggerel's done?

                        Politics!  Shmolitics!
                        Dole the Republican's
                        Balancing budgets while
                        Cutting your tax.

                        This only tells us his
                        Fiscal perception is
                        Incomprehensibly
                        Short on the facts.

                        Pitter pat, pitter pat.
                        Noah of Ararat
                        Heard the rain cease on the
                        Fortieth night.
                        Shem, Ham, and Japheth said
                        Antediluvian
                        Meteorologists
                        Called it just right.

                        Rubaiyat, rubaiyat.
                        Omar the Tentmaker
                        Lived on a diet of
                        Bread and white wine.
                        His moving finger wrote
                        Unretrogressively;
                        Not even cancelling
                        Half of a line!

<hr>
                        Dramatis Personae.
                        Laurence Olivier
                        Acting in Hamlet and
                        Richard the Third
                        Strutting and fretting like
                        No other thespian
                        Overenunciates
                        Every word.

<hr>
                        Woe is me!  Woe is me!
                        Printfest Diana cried,
                        "Charles and Camilla had
                        Shared the same bed
                        So I took a lover
                        And whispered sweet nothings
                        Cellularphonically.
                        Is my face red!"

<hr>
                        Higgledy jiggledy.
                        Strippers who bare it all;
                        Bellies and bosoms as
                        Tight as a drum.
                        Double dactyl has the
                        Rhythm that complements;
                        Tum-titty-tum-titty
                        Tum-titty-tum.

<hr>
                        Three little piggledy
                        Little Red Riding Hood
                        Skipped through the forest to
                        Visit her Gran.
                        A wolf who had got to
                        Her Grannie's before her
                        Dematriarchalized
                        Little Red's clan.

This next (and last for now) one doesn't follow all the rules but then I
still crayon outside the lines.

                        Fairy tale, furry tail.
                        Crockett of Tennessee.
                        He put the coonskin in
                        Millinery.
                        Spooner thought Davy had
                        Predated Henry Ford
                        And "built him a car" when
                        He was just three.

                        Halloween.  Halloween.
                        Witches and skeletons,
                        Goblins and ghosties all
                        Wearing white sheets.

                        Magical evening when
                        All of our children will
                        Unsymmetrickily
                        Scurry for treats.

<hr>
                        Mac attack!  Mac attack!
                        Mr. and Mrs. Spratt;
                        He never once ate fat.
                        She abhorred lean.

                        So, without cutlery,
                        Both of them (she and he)
                        Yinandyangistically
                        Licked their plate clean.

<hr>
                        Tragedy!  Tragedy!
                        Romeo Montagu
                        By Julie Capulet
                        Once was possessed.

                        Families hated this
                        And our protagonists
                        Apothecarily
                        Went to their rest.
</pre>

Yeah, yeah, I KNOW Julie stabbed herself but the whole mess started with
her deliberate OD on tranquilizers!

                        Scalene.  Isosceles

                        Thought transmigration was
                        Good for the mind.
                        He's better known for his
                        Infernal triangles;
                        Hypotenuisances
                        Of the worst kind.

                        Kirk of the "Enterprise".
                        He's boldly going where
                        No man has been.
                        Dressed up in drag he'll beam
                        Into the ladies' room
                        Sanctumsanctorumly
                        Checking the scene.

Fooled by the ambiguity of Collins' first name, I mistakenly assumed
Barrie was a girl. Fortunately, he/she/it corrected me with the
following verse:

                        Absolute monarchist

                        Being a prince.
                        Thus, we've described all his

                        Somewhat suspicious, her
                        Mother told Dodgson, "She's
                        Unphotographable -
                        You go to hell!!"

Hi Alex
        Weather's lousy so here are 4 more:-

                        Missioner.  Missioner
                        Good Doctor Livingstone
                        "Missing" in Africa's
                        Dark trackless waste
                        When Stanley "found" him the
                        Doc thought his greeting was
                        Overpresumptuous
                        And in poor taste.
<hr>
                        Pattycake.  Watergate.
                        Tricky Dick Nixon was
                        Taping (for history)
                        His own demise.
                        Played back, it seems the tapes
                        Characteristically
                        Range from just stonewalls to
                        *xpl*t*ve lies.
<hr>
                        Chugalug.  Chugalug.
                        Franklin D. Roosevelt,
                        Pres. 32 of the
                        U.S. of A.,
                        Legalized alcohol
                        And is revered as a
                        Humanitarian
                        Since that great day!
<hr>
                        Cherry tree.  Cherry tree.
                        Baron von Munchhausen
                        Mangled the truth with his
                        Every remark.
                        All of his narratives
                        Lacked in veracity
                        (Terminologically
                        Wide of the mark!)
