             NOSTRADAMUS

          Abraca Dabraca
          Michel de Notredame
          Studied his navel,
          Foretold many things:

          Prognosticating, he
          Omphaloskepticly  *
          Told three de'Medicis
          They would be kings.

          *  Omphaloskepsis:  Meditation while contemplating
              one's navel.  An Eastern Mystic practice used to
              induce a trance.
