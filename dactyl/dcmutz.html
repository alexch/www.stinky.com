A friend of mine made me put my higgeldy-piggeldies on
my website.  After doing so I browsed to see if - no, where - 
there were others.  Needless to say I encountered yours.
Mine, plus a few told to me by friends, are on a subpage
of www.math.wisc.edu/~pemantle (or e-mail me at 
pemantle@math.wisc.edu if if made a mistake about the web address).
