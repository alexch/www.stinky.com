While I would object to anything double dactylic being referred 
to as "stinky", I was nonetheless overjoyed to find a DD page on 
your site.  I am a fan of John Hollander in general, and have 
read everything (well, nearly) he's written, including my copy 
of "Jiggery Pokery."

I have, I confess, written my own.  While they do not compare to 
the works of JH and AH, they are at least of some amusement 
value.  Following is the only one I can recall off the top of my 
head:

Higgeldy Piggeldy
Emily Dickenson
Wrote in her poems of
"tankards" and "heft" -- 

Rhyming for her was as
Easy as pie; she would
uncompromisingly 
slant to the right.

Of course, a little knowledge of Emily helps you get the joke...

I once wrote a DD series in honor of Boomadal Adulyadej (the 
monarch of Thailand), but, thankfully, it has been swallowed in 
the mists of obscurity.

Yours in double dactyls,
