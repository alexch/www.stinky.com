I was inspired by your double-dactyl site, so I wrote this. Not bad for my
first effort, what?!!

[Not bad, but where's the double-dactylic word in the final stanza? -A]

_Apocalypse Now Redactyl_

Slippola sloppola
Francis Ford Coppola
Said while recutting
"Apocalypse Now,"

Rereleased pictures, see,
Smell just like victory!
Nothing's more sure
To make critics say "wow"!
