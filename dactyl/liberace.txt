          LIBERACE

      Fiddle Dee Diddle, De
     Great Liberace was
     Sorely in need of
      A given first name.
           
     Something flamboyant, like
          "Mo pianissimo"
     Might have been chosen to
     Highlight his fame.

     Flibberty Gibberty
       "Mo Pianissimo",
     That's what you picked
     For our fine-feathered friend?
 
     A quiet baptismal
     Is just a bit dismal..
       "Muchofortissimo"
     Seems more his trend.
