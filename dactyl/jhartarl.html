Subject: Double Dactyl

Hi -- I really enjoyed your double dactyl page!

I wrote one about a year ago, as part of a humor contest in The Washington
Post. (There is no such person as Martin J. Tupperman, I just liked the name
-- I'm not sure if that's a heinous violation of the rules.)

Higgledy Piggledy
Martin J. Tupperman
Little known scientist,
not quite renowned.

Proved his First Theorem of
Defenestration,
but landed before he could
jot it all down.
