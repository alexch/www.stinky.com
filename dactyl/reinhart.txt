Hullo, Alex.

I actually got to Stinky.com from a completely random link left by an
anonymous person at The Road to Nowhere
(http://www.smalltime.com/nowhere/).  Anyway, I was rather taken with
those cute little double-dactyls, and so I have come up with a few of my
own.  I suspect I'll write rather more of them, as time goes on...
Also, I suppose some of these break the rules, at least a little bit.
But heck, if a person can't throw in the occasional unstressed syllable,
then what's the point of art anyway? Shakespeare did it...

This next one is about my name.  The world is absolutely inundated with
Jennifers these days, and sometimes one is hard pressed to maintain any
sense of individuality...
