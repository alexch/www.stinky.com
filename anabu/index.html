<p> It's an ad for a construction company that builds "mansions", or
large concrete-block style apartment buildings. The theme is Little
Red Riding Hood. It seems (although I can't be positive) that the name
for her in Japan is accidentally similar to the name of the
company. (Company is Anabuki, LRRH is called <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Anabu</B>-something.) It's
possible, though, that they modified the name to make the ad
plausible/cute. [A friend says it is called Ookami to Akazukin (wolf
and red hood) in Japanese, I think."] The product they're advertising
is a particular kind of Mansion, named "Saabasu Mansion." It could
mean something, but I don't know what.

<p>
<h3>Text of the ad (long version):</h3>

Announcer: The new campaign girl for Anabuki Builders is the girl you know
so well...<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Anabu</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">kin</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">chan</B>! (Little Red Riding Hood!)<br />
<br />
Announcer: What's this? All the animals of the forest are here, too! All
together, let's read with spirit. 1...2... <br />
<br />
Chorus of girls' voices: <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Anabu</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">kin</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">chan</B>!<br />
<br />
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Anabu</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">kin</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">chan</B>: Hai! (=I'm ready!)<br />
<br />
Singing: <br />
It makes your dreams expand and grow, Saabasu Mansion<br />
It makes your hopes expand and grow, Saabasu Mansion<br />
It also makes your chest expand, expand, expand...<br />
<br />
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Anabu</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">kin</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">chan</B>, seeing enormous expanded raccoon testicles: Wow!<br />
<br />
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Anabu</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">kin</B>-<B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">chan</B>: Saabasu Mansion<br />
<br />
2nd announcer: Anabuki Builders<br />

I dunno if anyone has sent this to you yet --
apparently that animal isn't a raccoon, but a 'tanuki', which is
a raccoon dog native to Japan.  In folklore the tanuki is said
to have large testicles...

<blockquote>
"Sometimes you see Tanuki dolls with a bottle of Sake, Japanese rice wine.
This Tanuki wares cloth, but usually this kind of statue is naked, and...
Tanuki is famous for big balls. Senjojiki, literally means a thousand
Tatami space is a word to indicate its size. In Takahata Isao's animation
movie "Tanuki Ponpoko" is based on various legends of Tanuki. The story is
struggle of Tanuki against human being, who developed Tanuki's mountains
into huge residential site. Finally Tanuki lose and those who can disguise
lived as human-being ever after... You can see Tanuki utilizes his balls as
parachute for desperate suicide attack and a big treasure ship to send out
those Tanuki who can't disguise as human-being...
As refereed in Ponpoko, in Kagawa in Shikoku Island, A Tanuki named Kincho
is very famous."
